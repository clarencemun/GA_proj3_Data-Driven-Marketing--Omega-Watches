At first I was thinking it was a pre-77 version based on the logo.

       " {'body': 'To the original poster, here are the notes I have on this watch (gleaned from various sites on the web):In the late Seventies, when Cartier was looking to capitalise on the newly developed \"luxury sports\" watch sector (high-end pieces manufactured in stainless steel, exemplified by Audemars Piguet\\'s Royal Oak and, later, the Patek Philippe Nautilus) it chose the Santos as the means to do so.In 1978 the watch was redesigned and renamed Santos De Cartier by then-head of marketing Alain Dominique Perrin, who commissioned its first steel and gold models, adding an integrated bracelet in place of a traditional leather strap. Perrin executed another neat twist: the use of a part-gold case and bracelet. Known as \"bimetal\", the concept went on to influence watch designs into the Eighties and beyond.-------------------------------------In 1978, Cartier redesigned and renamed the Santos de Cartier, giving the watch an integrated bracelet instead of the traditional leather strap. Cartier made the case and bracelet out of stainless steel, a true change in course for the maison that had only worked with precious metals before this time. Cartier also added 18k gold to the case and bracelet to give the watch a touch of luxury. This \"bimetal\" gold-steel design would go on to be extremely popular in the 1980s (think Wall Street\\'s Gordon Gecko), and, by the way, is making a bit of a comeback (our December 2018 Swiss watch exports report showing a rise in bimetal exports). Soon after releasing the bimetal Santos, Cartier also released an all-steel model.As throughout the history of Santos, the key updates here are subtle, but timely. The case, originally inspired by the silhouette of the Eiffel TowerNeedless to say, the Santos cemented its status as an icon and this year, you can rediscover the latest version of this famous square-case timepiece. So what are the changes? It still retains the square shape that speaks of the refinement and symmetry in the Parisian geometry of that time, as seen in the four angular corners of the Eiffel Tower.The eight screws on the bezel also remain. These were a miniature tribute to the abundant mechanical steel structures associated with the golden age of urban architecture.From a design perspective, this very first Santos bears all the hallmarks of a Cartier watch. Its contours clearly allude to the steel bridges spanning the Seine, and the monuments dotted around the capital. A square bezel set with screws, stylised Roman numerals, a railroad minute track, a sapphire cabochon set in the crown and a leather strap&#8230; form and function, elegance and practicality merge in this miniature object.-----------------------------------------------------The movement should be a Cartier Caliber 077 (based on an ETA 2671)----------------------------------------------------In 1987, the Santos was completely revised, renamed and relaunched as the Santos Galbée. The case lost its boxy looks and became more curved around the lugs, fitting better on the wrist than the original Santos.',\n",

That means it uses a one-piece, front-loading case construction with a split stem. The eight screws in the bezel go all the way through to slotted bolts in the back, just like the early Royal Oak or Nautilus. It is powered by the Cartier Cal 077 which is an ETA 2671, a fine, robust movement. The integrated bracelet is held together with these bizarre pins that are pressure-fit via tethered screws. It is the most bizarre arrangement I\\'ve ever seen and I am not surprised Cartier later abandoned it. The rest is pure Cartier in terms of fit, finish, and attention to detail. The deployant clasp, for example, bears the interlinked C\\'s and is sharply curved, intending to be worn further to the side of the wrist so that, when the clasp is closed, the \\'C\\'s are exactly centered on the back of your wrist. Later models also moved away from the one-piece case, because its distinctiveness doesn\\'t outweigh its inconvenience. \"',\n",

Just picked up a 1994/5 Cartier Vendome Trinity for my girlfriend for her 30th birthday as it checked the both the styling she kept mentioning, as well as the metaphorical symbolism of being a birth date watch and representing her 3 decades of growth and success. I bought it from Chrono24 from a Vancouver shop and the owner was extremely communicative and helpful, and has 29 sales on the site, but it was shipped without original papers and it was shipped from Vancouver to NYC. The problem, though, is the Cartier stores here in NYC won't authenticate it unless I send it in for service. I do want to commend this community for helping with my research... particularly on the JV relationship between Ebel and Cartier.So... based on all of that... I zoomed in on all of the dial details and everything looks crisp, the hands have sharp points, the signature Cartier writing is on the 7, flat gold flathead screws securing the case back, deep clear etching and not an engraved case back. When I took the back off, it had stamps for 18k inside along with the circular swirls, the movement matches the Ebel 859 and has the Cartier signature. Finally, the seller provided his own certificate of authenticity, which I'm not overly attached to, but also a service receipt from Otto Friedl, which another member on this site had mentioned to a Vancouver resident as a possible place to go have it checked out. Concerns: the etching on the case back doesn't match other photos I've seen online, dial reads Paris and not Swiss. Can I get some opinions on this as I paid market for it? ($2700 USD)    \",\n",

A buddy of mine also brought up a good point that this likely isn't the reference that would be commonly faked. I'm leaning heavily towards authentic at this point but wanted to get the afficionados to weigh in during my 14-day return period (yes I'm very aware this is better done prior to purchase but given it was 3000 miles away, here we are.)\",\n",

       " {'body': \"Hello fellow watch enthusiasts,I recently came across a vintage Cartier watch online and I am in need of some advice before making a purchase. The watch in question is a grey brushed dial with applied Roman numerals, two-tone quartz Galbée reference 1566 (or possibly 187901, I'm not entirely sure about the difference), featuring a date window at 6 o'clock.The seller has provided plenty of photos which I have appended a few below, and overall, the watch looks fine. However, there is one concerning issue mentioned by the seller: there are a few small bubbles formed on the dial. This has left me puzzled, as the dial appears to be a grey brushed polished surface of silver or steel. I'm unsure where these bubbles came from—are they a result of loose coatings or tampering by a previous owner? The rest of the dial seems to be in its original condition, so I'm not sure what the issue might be.My main questions are: Is it possible to fix these dial bubbles, and would it significantly affect the value of the watch? I am hoping that those with knowledge and experience with Cartier watches, as well as general watchmaking and maintenance expertise, could shed some light on these concerns. Additionally, I would appreciate any insights on whether this watch is a safe purchase considering the mentioned issues.Thank you very much in advance for your help and advice. I'm grateful to be a part of this knowledgeable and supportive watch community.Best regards,Nick\",\n",

After all, they see the brand from a far different point of view than you and I being merely “consumers”.For example, I bought my Santos medium a few months ago (with a handsome discount). I was at this same AD a couple weeks ago and he never received a steel Santos medium for the showcase; he still had the TT Santos medium in the showcase from a few months ago. He said they are not getting anymore watches from Cartier for the rest of the year. Yes, you heard that right… no incoming from Cartier for the next 3 months. He’s also the only Cartier AD in the region, next one is a 4hr drive away.So based on his experience with the brand, he’s in the best position to read between the lines.

In comparison, Cartier makes about 500k watches and now they\\'re plan is to make less and prevent discounts? Who would buy from them then? Most of their buyers are women who cares more that they are wearing Cartier jewelry than handcrafted watches with in-house movements and are third behind Rolex and Omega in turnover and their plan is to f that all up? To make less money?The excerpt below is from 2017 and the plan has seemingly worked and you\\'re sales associate is saying Cartier doesnt like this outcome?A few years ago, when the watch industry was enthralled with China and its seemingly limitless appetite for luxury timepieces, Cartier, flush with cash and perhaps some hubris, seized the opportunity to court men with the introduction of several inventive and highly complicated watches, each priced at more than $100,000.Today, however, Cartier has done an about-face: “Previous growth was primarily male-driven, more linked to gift giving,” said Antoine Belge, a Paris-based analyst at HSBC. “Growth in the next 10 years in China will come from women becoming increasingly independent financially.” (Beijing’s continuing crackdown on gift-giving doubtless has something to do with the change, too.)Mr. Linz of Watch Advisor said, “Cartier will reduce its engagement in men’s watches because it turns out that men are not so interested in Cartier watches as women. The Cartier client wants style, icons, history, emotions.” He referred to the revival earlier this year of Cartier’s iconic Panthère collection of women’s watches, which now includes an entry-level steel model for $4,000.“This makes it attractive for customers who’d otherwise go for a Longines, a Frédérique Constant,” Mr. Linz said. “This may push sales down in the beginning, but if the strategy works correctly, it will bring many more hundreds of millions in turnover.”And to drive the point home, in 2020:Richemont Group (18.2% of the market), whose star performer is Cartier, which alone accounts for 40.7% of the revenue generated by the conglomerate. The next closest best sellers of the group are IWC (2.7%), Jaeger-LeCoultre (2.1%), Panerai (1.6%) and Vacheron Constantin (1.5%). So the Richemont Group saw this and said, \"we\\'re making too much money off of Cartier, our plan from a couple of years worked, lets slow down a bit because we aren\\'t Rolex...\"?In my .02 cents, if he thinks this is how Rolex creates their demand then he doesnt know much nd id trust him less.',\n",

This could be just because the photo of yours is slightly shaky.If you can register the serial number on the \"official\" Cartier website, most likely it is okay.A WARNING to everyone, there are fake watches come with fake warranty card. If one uses the QR code on the card to register the watch, it will bring you to a fake website. The site will ask you to enter the usual personal information to register the watch; it will then tell you it went through okay. In fact, it is phishing your information to run other scams.

I have met folks who see the leaving the stamps on the back as similar to leaving the tags on clothing, or on the boot of their automobiles.It took thoroughly searching the case and finding not a single metal stamp at all, and then opening it to find an FHF 69N ST movement without any Cartier signature to be found, to convince me it wasn't really a Cartier with some bad repair jobs/customizations.Thank you for this posting... it took me a while to figure out what I had actually bought, and your post here is perfect confirmation.\",\n",

That is a watch you could wear for the rest of your life and always be in style. Nice movement that should be simple to have serviced over the life of the watch too. Only issue I had with this option was (at the time of my shopping) this was only offered in rose gold while I prefer yellow gold. The dial details are noticeably nicer from relatively far between the Must and the LC. Also, the strap on the Must was significantly worse than the strap that was on the LC I tried on.

Cartier Tank LC historically worn by Truman Capote, Warren Beatty, Princess Diana, as it suits their lifestyle. Studio 54, gala dinner, fundraising, all the places where you have the watch dry and not bump it over a table somewhere. It's a very nice watch with a very distinct style where you can spot one from across the table. And just the aura of the watch, paired with impressive provenance, makes it super elegant. Even snobbish, at times.1. Yes, I wear my Tank LC everywhere including weekends. It pairs well with either a classic black t shirt or a formal suit just fine.2. Depends on how careful you are with it. If money is no object, Tank LC in solid gold is the ultimate Tank. Every time I went to a nice restaurant, I just can't believe how beautiful it is under a warm dim light. The smooth gold brancard reflect lights in a very nice silhouette. Not to mention the beautiful candy-like mineral crystal with roman dial, made you question if the year is actually 2024 or 1924. Unfortunately, it scratches like crazy tho. Especially if you wear short sleeve, it will bump against anything. Tank Must in stainless steel might be an option if you don't want to baby your watch, but it won't look as precious as a solid gold Tank Must.3. Get your Cartier pre owned and always size small. They are not meant to be worn big. If we draw comparison to shoes, they'll be a pair of sleek dress oxford shoes.

I am looking for a more everyday dress watch look.I wanted to add a leather strap to the watch. Have any of you done so already? Please share photos if so. If not - I have the concept I worked in Photoshop (Not great - but you get the idea, below).Is the bracelet easy to remove? Can someone advise on how to do this?I want to start with this bracelet removal step and then look at the leather options (Whether it is even possible, between the lug bar and case - looks awfully thin). Enjoy and do give me your feedback! I want to go back to the basics / art deco vintage look with this one.\",\n",

       " {'body': 'Hello fellow watchfam, I generally do not do posts other than sales corner posts. However, I had an interesting yet frustrating situation that I hope anyone with cartier knowledge or cartier service history can chime in on.This is my second cartier purchase therefore, service procedure and knowledge definitely are not my strong point.Here\\'s the story:So about a month ago I purchased a cartier Santos de Cartier medium two tone from a private seller here in the forums that purchased the watch grey market. I generally buy Rolex, AP, and omega from either the AD or from forums dealers that I know and trust.He had a comparison thread on the TT that he sold me and his stainless steel variant with plenty of photos.Long story short I\\'ve had the watch for approx 2 months. It came from the UK to me here in the US.Came with inner and outer box, warranty card, manual with AD purchase stamp and hand written signature, brand new deployment unused in original cartier box and stickers, new strap unopened, plastic bezel protector, hang tag, original shopping bag.Got the watch and immediately registered it on cartier.com and they even offered the extended 7 year international warranty which I didn\\'t ask for.Fast forward about 3 weeks ago and the watch quit working. No problem right?Well I request service and wait for a service kit to be delivered and I get  nothing for over a week. I finally call them and they say they are out of service kits and I would have had to wait until more came in??? Well how was I supposed to know that... keep in mind this original service request kit is still pending lol.So the ambassador sends me a label and on the paperwork direct from cartier they instructed me to send the watch without  original box and or accessories other than the bracelet and photo copy of the warranty card.So I send it in and wait about 1.5 weeks and no service update other than me checking tracking that it indeed was received. So I call them and ask for an update very politely. They begin to ask many questions where I purchased the watch and finally after a bunch of back and forth I get a reply that service deemed my watch counterfeit.Okay I\\'m floored and so confused. After about  4 days I finally get ahold of someone directly in service customer care calls and I ask if the watch could be further inspected.Just called them back yesterday and I\\'m informed that they think the gold is plated due to it being \"sightly to dark in hue.\" Keep in mind I generally only buy solid gold pieces for my collection and I\\'m pretty knowledgeable about gold etc.They also informed me that they felt the bracelet had too much \"give\" there exact words not mine. In addition, they said the movement was not 100% a cartier creation. They would not elaborate If that meant it had been tampered with or it 100% was counterfeit.They asked if I wanted the watch shipped back to me and said they gladly would ship back if I provided a label.I have not opened the watch due to Keeping WR and I honestly had no questionable thoughts.I will update this thread with movement pics once I receive the watch back.Here are some photos.One of my questions is has anyone had experience with cartier denying service due to the watch being grey market?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk',\n",

They don't care where you buy from, as long as it is a genuine Rolex.

He would have known right then and there if it was real or not, right?Sounds like that's the next step, movement photos.  If it turns out the be original, I'll be pretty disappointed in Cartier.

I have an older white gold tank americaine (circa early 2000s) which I had bought second hand from a reputable dealer of second hand and vintage watches. I sent it for a service immediately. I went to an AD which sells Cartier. There was no dedicated boutique where I live. The sales person was a bit suspicious but informed that they would send the watch to the Richemont group service centre. They would assess the watch and if they felt it was fake would then return it to me.. fortunately for me it turned out to be genuine but with a few surface scratches which were all buffed out during the service . That was about five years ago and the watch remains in good working order and gets a lot of use. It’s has unfortunately required a few surface scratches but are they not so noticeable and mine so I am not too bothered by them.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk',\n",

A few notes about the work they did, The 'refreshed' dial paint is more of a traditional burgundy rather than the rusty red colour of the patinated original. I suspect that was the original colour and it had faded over the years.they re-blued the hands. The hands are still clearly burgundy but with an additional bluish reflective sheen.they replaced the scratched glass with identical shaped glass face, which is slightly domed. This glass gets a bit of surface reflection, more so than the flat glass on the more modern tanks.I'm very happy to wear it and wind it each day. I love the manual wind mechanism. To me this sets it apart from many other small and mini Tank LCs, especially for ladies.For the person that inquired, I'm not looking to sell any time soon.

I had a 18mm mesh bracelet lying around so I tried that look and really like it on my 18cm wrist.View attachment 16660933I also opened up the case and see that there’s a rechargeable Panasonic battery inside. I wasn’t expecting that. Who knows what that means for the advertised 16 year lifespan.View attachment 16660943View attachment 16660945Something that I learned from @timetraveler812 on Instagram: there is a relatively simple way to tell the difference between the Solarbeat and the standard quartz.

AD that I purchased from and did send the watch to Cartier to fix the first time, there was a record from Cartier. So I think the AD did the correct thing. Cartier just didn\\'t fix it the first time. So this time, I printed out a detailed explanation of the problem and images showing the problem and brought all that to Cartier Boutique. With all that, Cartier seems to fix the problem. But I am still in the early days of getting it back. We will have to see, but it feels like they fix it. From my experience of looking at it, especially at 12 midnight when the second hand and minute hand change past the 12 midnight, the date with this new fix jumps very crisply to the next date. But the watch before the fix did not jump crisply (if \"crisp\" is right word) to the next date, it was off to the center at midnight already. It could be a quality control problem or could be design problem still because we won\\'t know how long the part that regulates this date change will wear out. It is still a nice watch that tracks a very good time. I guess if anyone is planning to buy this, should test out the watch by setting time at 11:58 or so before the midnight and see the date jumps when passing 12, especially with double digit dates to make sure your watch functions correctly.',\n",

       " {'body': '(A little long)Don\\'t know if folks have enough exposure to the new large Tank Francaise to have an impression, but I\\'m curious about the watch.  Hadn\\'t considered one until I read somewhere here about its introduction in the large size.  This past weekend I saw one and tried one on at a Cartier boutique.  I liked it. And it seems to settle my lingering anxiety about my large Santos.  As is apparent by posts here, a number of others wrestle with the choice between the medium and large Santos.  After a few trips back to the dealer to keep trying to like the medium Santos, I know that it doesn\\'t work for me, and I am very happy with the large Santos.  But, for me at least, it isn\\'t a wear with anything watch.  I wear it regularly, but find it is just too \"present\" to wear with dressier clothes.  I have other watches I wear instead, but I am fond of the Cartier design and vibe and would have loved the Santos to be available for all occasions.  The logical, though pricey, solution would be to get a medium Santos as well; and I\\'ve now heard of two folks who have done just that.  But I\\'m just not fond of the medium on me.Which brings me to the Tank Francaise.  Unlike the Santos, it really began life as a woman\\'s watch.  At the large size it doesn\\'t look or feel like that to me.  So I\\'m interested in what others think.  I believe it does solve the \"dressing up for dinner or theater or a concert\" problem.  It wouldn\\'t replace my large Santos, which for me is  a perfect watch for the rest of the day: in jeans or shorts.  The Tank Francaise is also a pricey solution, and I\\'m a little on guard about my eagerness to solve the Santos puzzle running ahead of my rational self.  ( I am, by the way, not unsettled by the fact the Francaise runs on a modified Sellita movement.)Here\\'s a photo off the internet:',\n",

Still, you really don\\'t need an excuse to want the Francaise.  If there are times you\\'d prefer to wear it over the Santos, and can afford it, then get it.  It\\'s a D**M fine watch!  If you think it fits you better dressed up- Rock it !Two, I personally do not think the Francaise is any dressier than the Santos. In fact, I think it is sportier.  To me, the Santos on a bracelet leans towards sporty.  The Santos on a strap starts to dress-up a bit.  To me the Santos looks dressier on a strap than the Francaise does on either a bracelet or a strap.  I love the Francaise on the bracelet.  I dislike it on a strap. The lugs/sides are too large (for me). But, it\\'s a D**M fine watch!  If you like- Rock it !Three, I do not think the Francaise L/XL looks like a ladies watch, but I think there are plenty of women who could wear it well, just as I think there are many men who could easily pull off a Medium to even a Small.  One of my only watch friends is a smaller dude who wears 46mm+ watches all the time and he pulls it off.  Muhammad Ali wore a Tank, which was incredibly small by today\\'s standard.  Wear what you want, and what feels good to you and don\\'t worry about what gender the watch is marketed to.  It\\'s a D**M fine watch!

I would normally put them by a window when not using them.  That being said they were all designed with a solar panel face, so there was a lot of surface area to collect light.

I’ve wanted a tank for quite some time but the solo didn’t cut it the others where to expensive. I would happily spend 5-10k on a tank if it were a daily watch but this would be worn relatively seldom. I love the look of the watch but in this day in time I do not dress up enough where this would fit. The cost of this one really nails it for me. It has the look I love of the more expensive Cartier at a very reasonable price. Further I see Cartier discounted from time to time on gray market sites.  I was going to buy a tank solo a year or two back and when I’m the store they wouldn’t discount but immediately offered up two straps in addition to the one that was on it so it might be worth asking about. Ymmv.I foresee myself purchasing this if it looks as good in person. The fact is with no second hand who besides you is really going to know it’s a quartz. And like another poster my main problem with a quartz (really shouldn’t worry) is what if it dies when I’m wearing it. I know in this day in age I have a cell phone and everything else but my personalOCD would be going nuts that I have a non working watch on. I believe this solves the issue.the main fact is like to know I have not seen yet is in direct sunlight how long to charge to full and once it’s fully charged how long does the battery last.
