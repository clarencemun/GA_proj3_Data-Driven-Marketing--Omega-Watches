I took in account Seamasters with an automatic movement, a rotating bezel and a size of 39mm and bigger.Note that I do not pretend to know everything on the issue, and many points are unclear. I based my search on a maximum of sources, but it turned out that those that were supposed to be the most reliable are partly wrong  (Omega by Richon, Omegamania, ..). I\\'d love to buy a \"SEAMASTER ONLY\" book, but I\\'m afraid that it will never be possible as the production of Seamasters was much more anarchic and less regular than Speedmasters.I do not have the 3 older models, nor \"pre-Bond\" models nor the 2009 Ploprof, so pictures of these models are credit Omega (catalogs / website)Seamaster 300Semaster 300 from 1957-CK2913 model: recognizable by the \"broad arrow\" hour hand,  straight lugs without crown protection, small triangles dial, thin bezel insert missing most of the time.

The photos are of my personal watch, with which I dived in locations from Hatteras to the Virgin Islands from 1987 to the early 1990s. It did not have a screw-down crown and had a snap-off caseback, but I never had any problems with its water resistance.Truly impressive catalog you have assembled here ... a lot of work.

The Seamaster 120 Plongeur DeLuxe, often referred to as the \"Jacques Mayol\" Seamaster because it was worn by him on his record-setting freedive of 101m in 1981, had an integrated bracelet. The photos are of my personal watch, with which I dived in locations from Hatteras to the Virgin Islands from 1987 to the early 1990s. It did not have a screw-down crown and had a snap-off caseback, but I never had any problems with its water resistance.Truly impressive catalog you have assembled here ... a lot of work.

To me they looked like a SM120 hands, and many members over at Omega Forums also thought the same.

       " {'body': \"Need help. Since childhood i enjoyed watches a lot. From birthday party money i bought Timemaster with full lit dial on button push. Got it to this day. It was quite cheap so when battery run out and velkro band was super dirty i put it in drawer.Then some time passed and after finished school and got first business successes i got no clue how but got my hands on Omega catalogue. Chosen one watch, advised family member if its reasonable to spend so much (it was huge money then, around 2,5 paychecks of computer scienstist at that time) on a watch. In shop i got showed selected model and 2 similiar ones. One i chosen through catalogue was too bulky so i choose similiar version. Bought Omega Seamaster Professional 300.Since then 13,5 year passed, and it was on my hand since then (even during shower or sleep). But it stopped and its now in service. Love this watch, its still beautiful. During service job i dont have anything worth to wear on its place, using now cheap quartz $2 watch from china while waiting for my watch. Its painfull.In past 2 years i 'studied' watches a lot. I get to know all versions/types of watches from Rolex, Omega and Patek Philippe. I know history and main features of each brand like Blancpain, Seiko, Grand Seiko, Longines, Citizen, Richard Mille, Casio/Gshock and many many many more but i still feel i dont engage  in 'watches'.I tried to buy some watch but not sure why, i mean i love my watch, my Omega Seamaster 300 have so much sentimental value that no matter how cool watch i learn about and see i can't say it would replace my watch if i buy it. Best looking watch i learned about was nautilus, but then learned its almost impossible to buy at retail. Second best was Pepsi and Lefty, but even if i would manage to get them, i still doubt they would replace my beloved watch. If any watch would have any chance i would try them first.So i cant replace my watch, maybe for special task i would buy a Gshock for Sup (Ocean swimming/activity), but i would use it maybe once a year so there is little point to spend $120 on that. Was using my Omega for this anyway before.Im on list for Rolex Oyster Celebration and Patek Philippe Calatrava, but year passed already and nothing happened and still i wouldnt use these watches as daily. Probably would still buy them as diversification of investments but only for that (maybe also enjoying from time to time to look at them ). To summary this, im learning still about more watch brands, im trying to find watch i would like to buy and spending a lot of time on that, but in reality im one watch guy and i cant justify buying any other watch to wear (investment only long term). When i like some watch like Citizen Tsuyosa yellow dial, buying it its pointless for me, too low water resistance to use it my way and way less premium feel/finish than Omega i own. Same with Sinn 556 A RS, love the looks, water resistance good enough, but movement is so much worse than my Omega, cant justify buying it. Always something preventing me because my Omega doing it better anyway and have additional huge sentimental value.Watch collecting is not for me, i like my one watch, but i want to engage in watches more, how to do it? Need advice.TLDR: want to engage more in watches, but im super happy with my Omega and any other watch i see is either  too big, too low water resist, worse movement or impossible to get on retail when it would have chances to replace it. On top of that no watch would beat sentimental value i have for my Omega. How to engage in watches more without buying and already spending so much time reading/exploring watch world?PSI dont buy second hand, anything, watches also. Only new things.\",\n",

I was hoping this thread could include photos of all ATs, from both generations, Co-Axial or quartz, and also all modern Co-Axial Railmasters.So, if you're down for a little fun, please post up photos of all your ATs and RMs! (Please include the model number if you know it.) With all the great photographers that we have here, there are definitely going to be some very cool photos in this thread!|> |> |>\",\n",

Well, if you do it yourself, you'll likely polish out those markings and symbols Omega put under the lugs, and that is likely going to reduce the value of the watch.  your scratches look too deep to do anything effective on.Mothers mag polish was mentioned above, and while that is relatively mild, it will make a mirror finish (doubt you want that).   you probably want a satin finish to match what the watch had originally, and the grain has to match the direction and curvature of the original grain.  Probably a grey or white 3M pad. The biggest problem, besides removing the OEM engravings, is rounding off the crisp sharp edges of the case and making it look horrible.I would leave it as is.  If you do go forward, practice on a cheap watch and see how it goes.  Then maybe try matching the brushing on the bracelet.

Second, I don't think polishing will help these scratches. You're going to need to remove material, which will require some sanding. I'd suggest automotive type wet/dry sandpaper. You can pick it up at most hardware stores. You'll probably want to start with 400 or 600 grit. You'll also want to sand only in the direction of the original finish marks on the case. I've also used 1,000 grit to refinish the brushed finish on an Omega. The trick is to pull the sandpaper across the finish in straight lines parallel to the direction of the OEM brushing. If you truly feel you need to polish a case, you can progressively sand the area (start with 400 and progress to 2000 grit), then finish with a cloth and some polishing compound. A dremel tool with a felt polishing bob and some jewlers rouge can quickly bring the finish to a mirror finish. I refinished the case on my Seamaster about a week ago using the 1000 grit sandpaper and a dremel on the polished area and it looks brand new. You just have to exercise caution when using the polishing bob to not round over the sharp edges between the polished and non-polished surfaces.\",\n",

       " {'body': 'Some of you mightve seen a few posts from me from a couple of weeks ago, when my dad became a proud owner of a new Omega Seamaster 300 (Heritage) with the Summer Blue dial. For \"quality control\" reasons 😅, my dad graciously lent me his new watch for the last couple of weeks so I can do a deep dive to spot any defects that may not be apparent at the store, as he isn\\'t the type of person who would spend the time to inspect the watch with a loupe or put it on a timegrapher. Today, I want to share with you my review of his Seamaster 300.Dial:Starting with the most unique attribute of this watch, which is the dial, the gradient summer blue color is stunning. Light powdery blue color in the center and progressly becomes darker as you migrate away to the edges, this creates a beautiful light color dial feel yet offers tremendous contrast against hour markers and minute track. The sandwich dial is not unique to the summer blue offering, but the light blue color lower layer that provides lume for the watch is special for this model. Personally I wouldve prefer a white or cream color under layer so it isn\\'t blue on blue on blue, but on the wrist the light blue hour markers are obviously but subtle at the same time. The arrow hour hand, dauphine minute hand, and lollipop second hand is no different from other Seamaster 300 Heritage, and like the other versions, the color of the hands matches the hour markers so in this case it\\'s also the same light blue color.Bezel:Blue color bezel matching the theme of the watch, the ceramic insert has a deep blue color that is unique for this specific model compared to the other Seamaster 300s. Light blue lettering on the bezel matches the blue color on the hour markers and hands, which once again I wouldve prefer white or cream color instead, but that\\'s a small nitpick from me. 120 click - unidirectional is common for dive watches, but I must say this felt a bit gritty for my liking. The clicks were precise and assuring but not buttery smooth. Perhaps this is more about what I\\'m familiar with on my Submariner, as I haven\\'t had an Omega Seamaster in my collection for quite some time now. The knurling on the bezel offers plenty of grip, at least on my dry hands, certainly much more usable than the scallop bezel on modern Seamasters.Case:I love the case shape, love how it\\'s brushed on the side with some polished details (such as a polished ring between bezel and mid case), love the lugs which is quite similar in style to my Speedy FOIS, I even love the way the caseback tie into the rest of the case. At 13.9mm, it\\'s not the thickest out there but I can\\'t help but think how much better this watch would be if it\\'s 1 or 2mm thinner. The BB58 comes at 11.9mm and wears like a charm. The thickness doesn\\'t ruin the watch by any means, but it feels like a missed opportunity. I will however give Omega points as the first Gen Seamaster 300 Heritage was 1 mm thicker if my memory serves me right.I generally prefer smaller case size (40mm or under), but this one is comfortable to wear, despite my desire for this to be thinner. I dont have lug to lug dimensions, whatever that measurement may be the lugs definitely dont feel elongated or stretched.Caseback is engraved which I personally prefer over exhibition casebacks. Reminds me of my mid 2000s seamaster where it\\'s engraved with the seahorse-esq. animal (monster?). This one has Aquaman pulling on the hair of two Seahorses?Bracelet:Terrible. I dont like it. Too much play and jingle for a brand new bracelet IMO. Omega\\'s decision to polish the outer portion of the links and brushed the center links is the opposite of what I\\'ve typically seen done. I\\'ll stay open minded about it, but in my mind it\\'s going to get scratch up pretty quickly. The clasp is terrible. Bulky, the touch points against my wrist are sharp, the twin button release mechanism is the same design from 20 years ago except the execution is worse with more play than I remember, the push button tool-less adjust is very low tech compared to glidelocks on Submariners thats been around for more than 10 years. The only redeeming quality is the tapering of the bracelet, so visually I like the way it looks.if this were my watch I\\'d replace it with a leather/rubber/nato/canvas strap on day one. I believe I can also purchase the OEM Omega stainless mesh in 21mm, which is the lug spacing for this model.Seriously ... what is wrong with Omega. Why is there a 2mm gap between the clasp and bracelet.Summary:No a stranger to the brand, if anything i am a big fan of Omega and the Seamaster was the watch that started my mechanical watch journey. This is a fantastic watch that looks great, wears great, and exhibits traits of Omega through and through. I\\'ve liked the Seamaster 300 since it\\'s introduction about 10 years ago, then the Spectra version, and now the current gen. This particular edition being the 75th anniversary celebration of the Seamaster line is a nice special edition that blends the heritage aspect of the model, yet introduced enough unique touches to differentiate it from the standard models. I\\'ll be sure to print out all sorts of literatures about this watch, so years later when I find it in a drawer, y\\'all won\\'t tell me this is fake.Will report back if I end up with any issues, since this is a quality control assignment after all.One last photo for your viewing pleasure.',\n",

The polished elements being reversed is a good move on Omegas part as it reduces the chances of smudges that plague PCL watches.     My biggest criticism of the 300 heritage is the hand wobble when you set the time.   It doesnt affect accuracy but its disconcerting.I love all the summer blue watches.    Seriously considering the AT version',\n",

I instead pair it with the Omega blue/grey nato strap.To add some subjective observations...-The numbers on the dial are quite illegible in average light. But the dial absolutely pops in sunlight for which I think it was truly meant to be warn in, rather than a dim room.-The polish on the inner ring of the bezel has scratched very easily. But after the first couple you wouldn't notice. Installing the bracelet with the correct tools for a change will invariably mark the lugs unless you tape up the whole thing.-Resizing the bracelet is a faff. It uses two tiny screws on each side of the link which hold in a central bar. The screws do not bite easily when putting back together and are very small and difficult to line up. Rolex and AP do this so much better with one long screw.-It's a bit thick with the Nato but I wouldn't wear this with a dress shirt regardless.-Runs about +2 seconds a day over the past months. Very pleased with its performance-I love the jumping hour complication for setting to different time zones or just DST\",\n",

I find the tolerance on the Omga bracelet quite loose, the links and clasp wobble against each other, and the push button adjustment bulky and rudimentary. Even the construction of it with an outer clasp encasing inner clasp mechanism seems inelegant as an engineering solution. If anything I prefer the older and simpler diver extension or no tool less microadjust at all.As far as adjusting it while still on your wrist ... I interpret that to mean the clasp is open and the watch dangling to give you the room to adjust it? If that's the case you can do that with glidelock as well so I am not sure I understood that comment.In any case, I know I'm at fault for starting the comparison between the brands. Even without the comparison to another brand, I can confidently sat this is far from the top as my preferred clasps. I like my mid 2000s bond bracelet on my Seamaster, I like the bracelet on my 1861 Speedy. This one is a strong meh.\",\n",

Prices vary wildly from £250 to around £900, and I do have a price point, but what should I be looking at for a half decent model (I realise it varies by condition, of course, but I don't want to go silly), and 2. Are there issues with the 1425 movement I should consider. I gather they are stable as they've run for 40 years, but is anyone aware of any underlying issues I should be aware of?I'll probably snag one before too long, but especially with regard to the movement, if anyone has any advice it would be welcome. I have searched the forums here, and the internet, and nothing sticks out, but if anyone has experience with this, or similar models I'd be grateful.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"Hello to all!Very happy to show my new purchase: the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra NZL-32 (Black Magic).Wanted something a bit diffferent and fell in love with this model. Now, I do not intend to participate in the next America's Cup with my 8 feet rowing dinghy, but the function looks cool and is fun to play with. Also, a little added bonus, since the 5 holes on the left turn from white to blue to red, you can stop it anytime to slightly change the aspect of the dial (on the pic, I stopped at 8 min, showing half red/ hlaf blue).The movement is also quite original. It is not made in-house but combines an ETA with a piggy back Depraz. Due to this construction, the pushers are on the left and inverted (start/stop is down, reset is up).Overall, I just love it: it is truly an appealing watch.As for the negative, maybe two things:1- It is quite tall at 15.6 mm2- And this bothers me slightly: It is sometimes very difficult to read the time. The steel arrows appear black depending on the light, and the black circle on the dial center has a camouflage effect on the hands,. Especially with the hour hand, you only see the 2-3 mm tip that extend out of the circle.But still, little issues compared to the overall appeal. It did come with a steel bracelet, but since I am not a fan of bracelets, I already changed it to a sailcloth strap with blue stitching. I was lucky, the blue stitch is exactly the same blue as the one on the dial!Hope you like and if you are currently looking for a bit of a different Omega, this could be the one. They are still relatively inexpensive and no longer produced (it was not limited but the production run was short).\",\n",

       " {'body': 'Hi all,I am currently grappling with an invasive thought I had today regarding my collection and need to hear other opinions.Background: I’m on the younger (34) side of watch collecting. My collection currently consists of:Blue Omega AT 41White/silver Longines VHP 41Tissot Le Locle cream/white auto 38Tissot PRX Quartz silver/white 40Casio F91WA few pieces that I keep for sentiment:Movado Muesum Classic (belonged to my dad and gifted from him when he saw I was into watches)Citizen Ecodrive Chrono (wore this for years before I got into watches)A Geneva 14k solid gold quartz (this is just money lol - don’t even consider it a watch)Given my lifestyle I generally wear the PRX in when I have to go to the office and the AT is for weekends. I’m a bit shy of wearing my AT into work as I ride the train. Maybe it’s paranoia but I don’t want to be targeted for my watch. So this relegates the AT to becoming unwound and rewound a lot. Which creates a problem for me given the date change (this is the 8900 movement). More on this in a moment.I do plan on downsizing to just the Casio, the VHP (got it a strap for business casual/office wear), and the AT.Here is the rub; my AT suffers from a badly misaligned hour hand. That and given my wearing habits coupled with the 8900 hour hand adjustment I question if it’s really for me. I love my AT and bought it for myself as a milestone at work. I’ve worn it to my college roommate’s wedding as a grooms man, worn it hiking and in caves in CO, and to conferences. It’s truly a superb watch that I love. I’ve debated putting it on a winder but it would ruin the aesthetics of the watch box and how it looks on my night stand, etc. I’m particular on how I like things.The ask: So here’s where my question comes in. I see some good deals on the silver dial Railmaster (seeing a pattern here? lol). I like it but have never tried one on.  I got this silly idea to repair/service my AT, then sell it, and buy the RM.The way I see it is: Casio for beater/work outs/low profile, VHP on strap for casual/to work, and the RM for weekends and all other occasions.It’s an appealing course of action to me but I question if I’m making the right choice or just having an impulsive thought. Can anyone help or has anyone gone through a similar dilemma?TL;DR - Should I trade my AT in for a Railmaster as it better suits my wearing habits/rotation and a negative experience with the 8900 movement?',\n",

If after living with the AT a bit longer if you still feel like making a change then there's nothing to prevent that.BTW, I recommend sending the AT to Nesbit's Fine Watch Service (authorized Omega service agent).  Every time I have sent a watch to Omega for service it has come back with something wrong and had to go back to Omega.  Every single time.

That decision was driven by the hour hand on mine becoming misaligned. I sent it to Omega for repair under warranty, and it's now back good as new. However, I don't want it to happen again, so I try to be congnizant of the issue.That said, if you decide to fix/keep your AT and wear it every weekend, put it on a winder between uses and you shouldn't have to roll through the hours to reset the hours except for the time changes.I wouldn't worry about wearing an AT on the train, and I think the AT is a nicer watch than the RM. I'd keep the AT...and the memories it represents.BTW, @AEC, is Nesbits an authorized Omega service provider that can/will do Omega warranty work?

       " {'body': \"I own both the 2531.80 and 2254.50. They are both excellent watches. If I could own only one I would go with the 2531.80 as that is the iconic 1990's Omega Seamaster and I love Bond--especially Pierce Brosnan's Bond, who wore the 2531.80 in three movies (Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and Die Another Day). And of course it looks nearly identical to the quartz 2541.80 worn in GoldenEye.I will make these additional points:1) I do not like the Bond bracelet. I only wear it as a change up. I'm glad I have it but do not prefer the look. That said, I have numerous other bracelets I love with this watch including the Peter Blake speedy type bracelet and the gen 1 Aqua Terra bracelet. I've added an adjustable clasp to both. This also looks great with a blue rubber strap.2) If not for the Bond connection and my love for the color blue, the Peter Blake SMP would be my choice. It looks great and has the most legible watch dial and hand set I've ever seen. It also has one of best date window integrations in any watch I've ever seen. It looks like a watch you'd actually dive with, if people still needed a mechanical watch to dive with.Basically, you cannot go wrong with these two.*I'm not a fan of GMT watches (it's a useless complication for me) so it's a hard no on that model for me.\",\n",

I remembered to jump it ahead an hour so I wasn't late for work.The Globemaster graced my wrist on Monday. What an amazing watch!! I'm still considering picking up the blue dial as my next acquisition.As usual, I wore my Speedmaster on Tuesday. In my mind, it's still the most iconic watch of all time. Sure, there's a diver out there that might be more recognizable, but the Speedy wins for me when it comes to being an icon.I'm keeping with my rotation, the 300MC was back on the wrist on Wednesday. The 300MC and the Railmaster are the only 2 watches that aren't in constant rotation. I alternate them two weeks on and two weeks in the box, but I always enjoy having this beauty back in rotation;Thursday saw me switching back to the Globemaster. I keep the Speedy in constant rotation because, well, it's the Speedy. I keep the Globemaster in constant rotation because it's my only watch with a date complication, and I dont want to be changing the date all the time when the watch has stopped running. However, i think even if the Globemaster was a time only watch I'd still keep it in constant rotation just because it's so beautiful;That's my old Carhartt trucker jacket I'm wearing in this picture. It must be close to 15 years old. Every edge of it was fraying, but I couldn't give it up. I had someone patch up all the frayed spots and it's back in action today, alongside another Legend;Great posts and photos, everyone!! Thanks for keeping this Friday tradition alive.@teeritz Tino, how are your feet doing these days??René\",\n",

It does take some fiddling about with the springbars to get both ends to snap in. But they will snap in and the strap is a nice fit appearance wise.That said, I would not recommend that watch with a rubber strap with jacket and tie. In my opinion, the look is just too casual. If you don't like the non-tapering Bond bracelet you have numerous alternatives. For Omega bracelets you can get a 1610/930 Speedy type bracelet, the bracelet for the gen 1 Aqua Terra, or the recently released stainless Milanese mesh.For non-Omega you can get a bracelet from Forstner, Uncle Straps, or Strapcode. All are fitted especially for the 41mm SMP. You can get a non-Omega Milanese mesh (for way less money than the Omega version). The watch also looks great with leather straps. I'm currently wearing my 41mm SMP with a brown Geckota strap. It looks great with blue leather too--even alligator straps look the business if you want to dress it up.The possibilities are basically endless...The following pics are of my 2531.80 for ideas (not the quartz but it's the same look).\",\n",

       " {'body': 'Alright, to address your points:1. I think green is one of those dial colours that will largely age poorly. In this regard, Omega plays it safe with shades of green that are mass appealing, but not particularly \"striking\" compared to some others. This is fine - you can buy the other brands, Omega does not care. 2. I suppose you are not aware both Swatch and Richemont groups do price increases 2x a year, every year. And you must also not be aware MOST watch values are abysmal on the secondary market compared to MSRP. Go look at something like retail and secondary prices of a brand like Arnold and Son and you\\'ll see how bad things can look. Many people buy new because shocker they are not enthusiasts who are ultra cheap with their watch purchases and who just go into an AD with a budget...and guess what...buy a watch regardless of how it may tank in value. This may be hard to perceive, but MOST new watch sales are not purchased by enthusiasts. I could go on about price increases, but at the end of the day Omega (or any Swatch/Richemont brand) doesn\\'t care about selling to you. They care about catering and pricing to an ultra wealthy clientele who are immune to economic fluctuations. 3. Honestly Omega could use a culling of some of their models and variations in my opinion, but they are trying to make something for everyone. Consistency in colours across sizes wouldn\\'t necessarily be a bad thing. 4. Again, you must not be aware of celebrity endorsements that other brands employ...look at Breitling. Or better yet, look at how Rolex markets itself across industries and you say Omega does too much? Also who cares, just ignore it and buy the watch you want. The Omega rant worth ranting about would be the obscene thickness of their modern calibres. To me that\\'s a much bigger issue than some celebrities rocking Omegas.',\n",

How can Oris smash this consistently at half the price?\\t\\tClick to expand...Seems that plenty disagreed with you on this count - those dark greens are hard to get your hands on considering the popularity they spiked.In any case, Omega made a business case decision to go with the darker colors because, as others mentioned, they likely see the overly bright colors like the Oris Kermit as a fad that will play out, and they'd rather not be caught with stock on hand that doesn't sell when that time comes. I could go either way - I like bonkers colorways when done right like, say - Studi0 Underd0g's Watermel0n, but I disagree with it in other cases - like Rolex's Bubble OP41. That said, those watches aren't for everyone - they have niche audiences, and I don't think Omega is interested in playing to niche audiences with colorway - they already do that with some of their special edition designs like DSOTM or Silver Snoopy2. Relentless price risesSo much to say on this:a. Omega need to re-learn who their core audience is: working professionals.

Or the 38mm Aqua Terra shades which are significantly more expensive than other 38mm models.\\t\\tClick to expand...You're gonna be beating a dead horse with this. No brand has managed to avoid the 'relentless price increases' pretty much every brand has had to jack their prices up as they move further and further upmarket with watches becoming more and more irrelevant as day to day tools. My Speedmaster purchased in 2013 has seem a relatively similar TOTAL price increase to date as my father's Two Tone Submariner purchased in 2010. Longines, Hamilton, Tissot, Tag Heuer in my collection have also seen price increases, though Hamilton and Tissots' were much lower overall percentages to date. Heck, the only brand displayed in my watchbox that has shown the LOWEST price increase over time is/was NTH.As to resale, why would the brand give a real flying flip what the resale of the watch is on the aftermarket? They are catering to those who want to buy new - you may be OK with not buying brand new, but for those who value having had no other wrists touching said watch, the AD/Boutique is catering to said audience.How much do car manufactures wring their hands over resale? And considering how much car loan debt is owed in the USA alone at this moment, how many people are using similar logic when making car purchases - it seems, in that market, EVERYONE wants new and no one is buying a decent 2-3 year old car with lowish mileage because they don't want to deal with the previous owner's butt imprint in the driver's seat  3. Inconsistent sizes/colours within the rangeNot exclusive to Omega to be fair, but I wish they'd be consistent in their size/colour offerings. The Aqua Terra is a prime example.

How hard can this be?\\t\\tClick to expand...As you acknowledge, this isn't exclusive to Omega (actually, on that note, few of the arguments in this OP are/were). Every additional SKU requires additional tooling, additional costs to design, manufacture, store, and sell. To you or I, as consumers, it may seem like a proposition of 'how hard can this be' but they have dozens of employees that work out the day-to-day logistics and economics. These are the decisions they came to, whether you like it or not.4.

There will always be celebrity or marketing associations with brands, including luxury brands.  Perhaps you should just stop following their instagram account, and problem solved.2. I feel you have some merit here.  The Moonwatch used to be the ultimate entry into fine, Swiss watches.  Omega build quality, incredible heritage/history, goes with everything, recognizable outside the watch community, gives you instant watch cred no matter what the guy next to you has on his wrist, and was within financial reach of your average guy (particularly used).  Now, a hesalite Moonwatch with a bracelet is $7,000.  Yes, they've made several visual and technical improvements to it, and it still has value at the current price, but holy $#!+.  I think this was one reason why they ok'd the Moonswatch.  It's the only way to get someone into a new Omega that doesn't light their cigars with $100 bills.  Unsurprisingly, it's sold like crazy and, according to Omega, has generated sales with the real thing.  I would call moving the Speedy so upmarket a mistake, but clearly Omega doesn't think so.  But it really is a shame that it has become so exclusive.\",\n",

It is a feature, not a defect.Your PO and its Cal. 8500 is altogether something else.Edit: I would base the need for servicing on whether the timekeeping and so on are within specification or not.

I sent my Speedmaster Mk40 for service at about 12 years of ownership, not because it stopped but because it started to act \"funny\" (from steady being 4~5s/day too slow to 10~15).  Back then it was about 650€ and you can bet it came back better than new; carefully repolished and barely +1s/day with almost perfect numbers on the time grapher.2 years and a half after service, the chrono system failed so back to service.  I suppose the official dealer that I left the watch to could have a commercial detail it they were better willing or I had pressed more, but that was not the case: full service price again, only by then it was like 950€ instead of 650€ (in 2 years and a half!)  Again, superb job (this time I declined polishing as I felt it unneeded): time grapher almost same values only this time it goes less than 2 s/day too slow instead of a bit over +1s/day.Does it make financial sense? Certainly not, as my Casio 5610 can attest.  Will I pay for next service if prices follow current trend? time will tell, but I\\'m inclined not to... today; when the time comes, I\\'ll decide.',\n",

I think you should be able to count on 8 years of reliability after service. I wouldn’t leave it a lot longer than that. One of the issues is that tiny bits of metal from the wear of the watch will mix with the oil and can turn it into a sort of grinding paste  that will accelerate the wear and tear in the movement. At an 8 year service interval you’re still less than $10/month in upkeep. Not too bad for a mechanical object that will outlive you with basic maintenance.',\n",

My 8500 Planet Ocean was serviced by Omega and the hour wheel broke two years and three months later.

Stuff happens.i would say that MOST Omegas that are serviced will provide years of trouble-free operation until the next service is required, but only Omega knows what that success rate is and it’s most likely proprietary information not shared with the public.
