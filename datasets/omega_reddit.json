Looks like the crystal may have the tiny omega symbol on this particular model, but hard to see it with the naked eye. Back story is it had one prior owner in Montreal who died and I bought it from the dealer that came into it. Works perfectly, including quick change for the date, keeps time well. Any thoughts on it, be it authenticity or otherwise?",

Overall the watch is in incredible condition for its age, and my favourite feature is the leather \"rally\" style bracelet that I haven't been able to find elsewhere on other reference pieces from the time period.\n\nIt's a 484 17-jewel movement, and upon inspection looks like the case has never been opened before, or has been well-serviced. Crystal has very few imperfections. Dial has a couple of tiny imperfections only visible under microscope, and case / strap has been cleaned but not polished. The watch has not been serviced but keeps great time.\n\nI'm looking to sell or trade, and want to price competitively / attractively to get a first transaction under my belt at r/Watchexchange.\n\nI'm located in Ontario, Canada.

You bought it from a dealer, so they should have authenticated the movement, case, etc, but redials are common.   \n\nHere are my questions/thoughts.\n\nFirst: Yes, the absence of Swiss Made is odd, and typically means a redial for watches of this age.  Also, it appears that the hour markers (particularly the 4 and 5 o'clock) and the \"Geneve\" aren't as crisp as I would expect.   Perhaps it's just the photo, or perhaps a redial from Omega.   I wouldn't bet my house on it, but if you're asking my opinion, i'm thinking redial.\n\nSecond: Here's an example of the movement.\n\n[https://www.aurifo.com/uk/a/interesting-facts-about-the-omega-565-movement](https://www.aurifo.com/uk/a/interesting-facts-about-the-omega-565-movement)\n\n The movement appears silver/steel in your photo.  I presume that's just a trick of the light, and that the movement is authentic.

So, Omega, but not \"original\" is certainly possible.\n\nI'm not an expert, just an enthusiast like yourself, and I'm looking at a photo, not the actual watch.  I'm always hesitant to be definitive.  But if you made me bet a week's pay on it, I'd think it qualifies as an \"original Omega\" even though it might not be the watch with all the same parts as originally sold (service dial).  But it's certainly possible.\n\nLooks like you're paying a bit of a price premium to get that though, so your digging is warranted.   Ask the seller what the history is and what they think.

You should do the same, to get your own take on value.\n\nWith that said, my thoughts:\n\nWhat's most important for you on this?  Are you just looking for the rep in WatchExchange and willing to give up value for it?  Or as much money as you can get?\n\nI went to a bunch of places (including ebay), and searched based on the movement, and then used plated watches as comps.  I excluded the solid gold (so plated only), and also pristine examples.\n\nAssuming it is running well, the proper spot for this is 100-300, i suspect , given what I'm seeing on various sales platforms.   But it will take the right buyer, and might take a few/several trips onto WatchExchange to get it moved.  Women's watches just aren't in that much demand, and it's plated, not solid.  I'm not sure how many women are on WatchExchange (you kind of have to be a watch geek or a dealer), and therefore suspect you would effectively be wholesaling it.  I suspect you could move it quickly for < 100 if the goal is to build history, and this might be the best you can do if your first criteria is that it has to be on WatchExchange.   So, where would I start if i had time to kill?  At 300, and cut the price each week until it sold.    With no time to kill?   $99, to get it into the $0-99 flair, and consider price cuts in a week.  But at $99, it's not much risk to a potential buyer, someone would probably bite.\n\nThese are my honest opinions based on the research.  Then, i had a parting thought.  Mother's day is coming, I might be interested, if you're in the \"quick sale\" zone.  My 86 yr old mom laments the Omega she lost, and it's about my budget for that gift.  Would be fun, and not much risk, and it would get you the watchexchange rep you're looking for.",

It truly brings a sporty look to an otherwise formal watch. The khaki color is also not too strong, so appears green and grey under certain lights.\n\nMy only complaint about the strap is that it cost more than double the cost of the strap for shipping and import duties.\n\nThe Seamaster 1948 70th ed limited edition is my favorite watch with perfect proportions, derails, and heritage with a modern twist. My only real gripe is that the highly polished case can easily pick up hairlines. Nothing that a polish can't handle, but there's time enough for that.\n\nHappy Sunday!",

Then,  do add follows:\n\n- Get the watch back\n- Take watch to an Omega AD IN PERSON\n- Have AD send out to Omega Service Center\n- Have them do a FULL service\n- If you need to pay for extra parts,  do it. \n- Don't even think about small claims court... you need to avoid every dealing with these banks again.\n\nMinimum for service will be $835-ish including tax and shipping. Omega might just replace the Franken parts for free. \n\nThis is the cost of owning nice watches, and it can always be worse.  I bought a 2201.50 last fall from a highly reputable seller. Watch was purportedly in A+ condition. But when I got it,  I realized within 24 hours that it wasn't auto-winding. The movement was broken. So after owning it for 2 days and having worn it for one,  I took the watch to my AD, had it sent for full service, and had it back about 10 weeks later. \n\nI've been wearing it frequently since then, and it had a 2 year warranty on the work Omega did. Unfortunately,  this is part of collecting watches and buying used. Yes, I could have tried to deal with the seller,  but at that point,  I just wanted to make sure I end up with a watch in perfect working condition,  and I could control that outcome by leaving the seller out of the picture.",

My last google search about 5 minutes ago was \"omega AD discount melbourne\" haha.\n\nI am also looking to purchase a speedmaster, although i am looking for the sapphire sandwich on the bracelet (rrp $AU 13,250)\n\nLast week i went to a smaller shop on collins st (not monards or hardy bros) and although they didnt have it in stock, they said best they can do is 12,500 (\\~5%) when it comes back in. They were lovely but didnt seem keen to budge from there.\n\nI then went to monards but they wouldnt talk price becasue i wasnt ready to buy last week, which is fair enough. It was also practically closing time.\n\nIm in the CBD tomorrow looking to buy. I was going to probably go back to monards and say i will purchase today if they can do it for 12k (roughly 10%) which sounds possible looking at your numbers.\n\nKeep in mind with chrono24, it seems like you will need to pay 10% GST + 5% import duty, which for the new watches immediately sucks away the value.",

Omega uses grade 5 for the less expensive \u201cgood planet\u201d model - so I find their use of cheap/soft grade 2 downright offensive on this $12k world timer. \n\nThere\u2019s a big difference between grade 2 and grade 5. Grade 2 is just pure titanium, no other alloys or components are added to increase strength - so it\u2019s a scratch magnet compared to 316L steel or grade 5.

Bottom line is they are already a larger company than all of Swatch group combined. Swatch had to resort to selling 1 million plastic quartz Speedy replicas and some garbage Tissot Royal Oak copies to grow their business. Laughable. Rolex has brought temporary production facilities online to try and keep up with demand while also investing in a brand new permanent factory and people like you are still peddling these dumb conspiracy theories with no data to back any of it up. \n\nInvesting and tooling factories is an incredible expense (i think I read over $1B somewhere for the new factory slated to come online by 2029) and Rolex is smart to do it the right way and not rush anything. The worst thing they could do would be to rush too large of an investment too quickly only to see demand fall back to where it was before Covid when you could indeed walk into an AD and buy just about any model aside from maybe a Pepsi or Daytona. And a few years before that, even Pepsi\u2019s weren\u2019t that hard to come by. Demand just exploded during Covid and hasn\u2019t really let up since then.",

That doesn't mean that their fan-base in the bottom of their market should be pleased that they're thriving elsewhere, nor does it mean that they can't be upset that the brand has decided that they aren't interested in serving them. I don't know why you feel the need to defend a major corporation with this sort of fervor when they're not even being slandered.

It literally goes with everything and fits in any situation, the quintessential GADA watch.\n\n Only mistake I made was going with the larger model (41.5mm at the time) because a friend told me it looked better on me. I ended up realizing I preferred a smaller size and sold mine to replace it with the current 38mm model. Definitely try it on first and decide for yourself.\n\nEdit: My only (and probably a lot of other people's) complaint is the bracelet. It really could use a quick adjust clasp. A company called Steel Reef is supposedly developing a Rolex style \"EZ Link\" for the AT, but who knows if it ever happens. Really hope they do end up offering it because it would make the AT an absolutely 100% perfect watch.",

Other watches also went to space as personal items. \n\nWhat makes it stand out to me is that NASA took a 1950's watch and ran it through a battery of tests that almost certainly would have killed the poor astronaut wearing it. We're talking pressure tests, shock tests, temperature fluctuations from 0\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F cycling back and forth, then again under 95% humidity. It was the only watch to pass all the tests. \n\nNASA tested the Speedmaster again in 1972 and again in 1978 for the Space Shuttle program.\n\nArguably, at the time it was, objectively, the \"best\" watch. (Today, I'm sure a G-shock would do nicely.) \n\nSo I'm no engineer, but it's a testament to pure mechanical ingenuity. The fact that we can make a perfect time measuring machine using technology from the 18th century, small enough to fit on a wrist (even yours!) is amazing and something to be respected.",

It was in bad shape so I took it to a local horologist, and he refurbished it for me with a new gasket, crown, an orignal omega replacement, a crystal, full overhaul of mechanism and he had also to recreate a broken piece of the mechanism. Did a fantastic job as opposed to the jeweller his wife took it to years ago, who absolutely butchered the case destroyed the crown and made a general mess of it.

I\u2019ll say that I like it a lot at this size on my wrist (~7.25 inches) but I personally wouldn\u2019t wear this reference if I had a smaller wrist. I think the style wants to be understated and it\u2019s a lot of dial at 39mm on a smaller wrist. The thinness and tapered shaped goes a long way to making it feel smaller than it is. I have a 40mm Stowa Marine Original that, on paper, is 1mm wider and ~0.5mm thicker, but feels SO much larger because of the case shape. Of this things stated thickness at least 1/3rd of it is the really deeply domed crystal.",

You don\u2019t need spend history to get one, you just need the money. Hope this helps clarify.",

Not saying Omega shouldn't offer the DeVille in the current sizes, but it would make sense to also offer male customers a more traditional size like 37-38mm. That isn't \"small\" by any means. It's medium for a dress piece.\n\nIt would make more sense than offering dress models that are all larger than some of their sports models (Aqua Terra for example). Especially since a thinner watch like the DeVille will show its size even more as it lays flatter on the wrist.",

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with it as my FIL owns one & I just don\u2019t get it. The fauxtina colour scheme just doesn\u2019t compliment the sporty nature of the watch and gives off old man vibes. Not a fan of mesh on watches generally and this is no exception (really chunky clasp, too). The overall finishing is just not as nice as the standard SMP. I will always die on this hill. It feels cheap. I really prefer the ceramic bezel, wave dial, & weightiness of the standard SMP. \n\nWould not pay a penny over retail for any mass market watch ever under any circumstances. $21k USD for a used Batman is highway robbery. \n\nBy process of elimination, the blue SMP would be my pick.",

I put a 3M film on mine--but that's because I wasn't sure if I was going to keep it at the time but I wanted to wear it and not have to resell with a bunch of scratches. I've kept it but left the 3M on there because it does protect it and doesn't hurt leaving it.",

That said, they need to stop going half way and having a jewelry store for an escapement, and make the whole damn thing silicon. It's probably not easy to do, but what's the point of having a super fancy escapement that's supposed to not even need lubricant, yet it needs it after all? If designed right, silicon escapements don't need oiling, either. Plus, it can be all pretty and purple and green.\n\nThe modern Railmaster Denim is the best watch Omega makes. It has the best iteration of the modern symmetrical case, the crown is easy to use yet sits perfectly out of the way. The engraving on the back is supremely awesome, the lume is outrageous, and it calls back to several Railmaster refs and creates a modern version. The bracelet is sturdy, feels great on the wrist, and I think it looks great on the watch.",

Sure, it certainly doesn't look as expensive as something like an AT, and it isn't, but I don't think it's because of the printed dial. People love IWC, and the vast majority of those are more expensive with printed dials AND lume, with matte or regular sunburst finishes. \n\nThe Railmaster has cut indexes filled with lume, which makes it last longer, and the dial actually changes a lot in sunlight. It can go from almost glittery, to copper, to matte blue just by turning it. It's also very legible, which after a while feels more important to me than having shinies all over it. The previously mentioned AT actually kinda sucks for legibility, unless it's the white one. Also, after owning an SMP, other than the depth of the indices and how even the lume was, it actually felt the same or even cheaper than the Railmaster.\n\nI do wish the bracelet had some micro adjust, but honestly if you wear the thing for a couple years you stop noticing shit like that, and start to enjoy the look and it actually feels quite comfortable. \n\nAll that said, this is just a whole shitload of opinions. If it's not your thing it isn't your thing, and that's cool, I just wanted to explain why I have my opinion a little more.",

But that\u2019s just my opinion, get the one that makes you happy and that you enjoy. Definitely get it on the bracelet though. It\u2019s super nice and I love the micro adjust.

He told me over our two hour watch geek out that the Snoopy is now considered by Omega to be  \u2018commercially available\u2019. \n\nHe said Omega had fulfilled all their back orders and it is now no longer a limited run. He said Omega was concerned about the high grey market prices and increased production to combat the upward market prices and if you want one you will be able to get one without too much difficulty from an OB. \n\nIt\u2019s great to see more people who want Snoopy\u2019s not having to sell a kidney to buy grey. This is how you look after your customers and not flippers. I love Omega even more for this.",

There are also stories where they ask you to buy other models in combination to get one, even if you already a known customer. Omega is using the Snoopy the same way Rolex does with their Daytona/Pepsi GMT. I doubt they would increase the numbers a lot, that would kill the hype for future models. For that purpose, they released the new white dial Speedy, this is a volume model.",

My first Breitling - an Aerospace - actually has a titanium bracelet with a spring extension at the clasp. It allows for a little stretch of the bracelet as you move. This feature is not on any of my later Breitlings. I have tried the Velcro \u201cApollo\u201d type band on my Speedy and it looks great and is also very comfortable, but I like the looks of the metal bracelet better and I don\u2019t wear the Speedy when doing a lot of work with my hands/arms.",

It looks nice in the media shots but i havent been impressed by the actual photos. Im not sure about in person yet. \n\nA further downside is i could get a prior year black speedy second hand from chrono24, or perhaps negotiate a reduced price for a new one at a local dealer/boutique. I highly doubt theres any wiggle room on the white.\n\nHoping to find some time soon to try both on in person to compare!",

All the pics of the oem mesh look amazing, but without knowing how I\u2019d like the look, I just couldn\u2019t justify the cost. So I found this one from Strapcode, and here\u2019s my simple review:\n\nThe mesh itself feels like decent quality compared to other mesh straps I\u2019ve owned. Though it has some rough edges, it still feels substantial and is finished well enough. While it\u2019s not the oem standard (nor I assume the Staib standard, though I\u2019ve never owned one), it doesn\u2019t feel cheap. That is until you get to the clasp\u2014 the clasp definitely feels cheap. That said, it seems secure enough that I trust it, and it\u2019s not nearly as bulky as the oem one, which I personally prefer. I also appreciate the 20mm to 16mm taper (I believe oem is 20-18mm). This is the main reason I chose the is one over the Staib which has no taper. The final pro which maybe is a personal one for me, is the use of quick release spring bars. Makes installing and removing so much easier!\n\nTL:DR pros and cons\n\nPros:\n\n*$62 price tag\n*Decent finishing and heft for the price\n*Elegant 20-16mm taper\n*Quick release spring bars\n*Smaller, less bulky clasp\n*The clasp system provides more options for sizing\n*No branding\n\nCons:\n\n*Clasp feels cheap\n*Some rough edges\n\nOverall, a great option for those wanting to spend less on a mesh bracelet! \n\nP.S. Thanks to those who commented on my post about whether to keep this chrome dial SMP or try the blue instead. Looks like for now I\u2019ll be sticking with the chrome!",

It's hard to to get an impression of the dial and in person contrast from people's iphone pictures (under the hot lights, subject too close to lens, etc) but if it has great black and white contrast as shown on the omega advertising I think it's a stunner.\n- it's FUN, hot, new. \n- it's everything good about the modern speedy pro (metas, better bracelet, legjt 50M water resistant, 15,000 gauss, etc)\n- and here's the big one (for me) it fits into my collection really well. I dont own a white dial and really want one. I've been looking at the explorer 2 (too large and I already own too much rolex) and ingenieur (rip off at $11,700 + tax) and others, but for many reasons that didn't happen. $8k to get a sweet white dial with the killer movement and bracelet in a wearable size? Seems good. \n\nCons \n\n- I know it's not limited production and the market sucks. Omega is discounting EVERYTHING at non boutique locations. The smart play would be wait a year and buy for 10-15% off from an AD or reseller.\n\n- Having owned and resold Speedys before\u2026. I can say with authority no watch I\u2019ve ever owned depreciates like a speedy. They\u2019re a dime a dozen unfortunately and if you like to rotate what\u2019s in your collection, as I do, it\u2019s dumb to pay full retail. \n\n- although the basic black speedy wears like a 40mm watch, this white dial? Who knows - for sure it will wear larger. But how large? Only time can tell. But the only thing stopping me from buying other white dial models I liked (from panerai, for instance, or the explorer 2 referenced above) was the white dial sizing. I owned the Tudor black bay chrono panda and sold it due to this issue. \n\nAs I said I have a deposit down so I should get called in to handle / buy in the next few weeks. Time will tell, but I\u2019m leaning towards buying. I\u2019ll just sell something that isn\u2019t getting wrist time.",

A white dial daytona is obviously going to cost, at retail, almost double the speedy and the chances of that are slim to none--if I'm spending (and I can't) $30,000 on a chronograph I'm getting the moonshine gold green dial speedy. \n\nSo, I'm very curious to see this one in person and solidify my desire for the racing 9900 model or this new one.\n\nSide note, I Wish the Tudor one had an hour counter...would have already bought it.",

Vintage Omegas are not as delicate as most might think, although obviously they can\u2019t do what g shocks can do. \n\nA big issue with vintage Omega is originality, like if it\u2019s a franken watch (serviced with parts not original to the watch) or if it already lost its original finish aka it was overpolished. \n\nI highly recommend browsing [omegaforums](https://omegaforums.net)",

It will always be cheaper to go with a local watchmaker than to send a vintage piece in to the brand itself. \n\nSince they\u2019re older, vintage watches will definitely be more \u201csensitive\u201d but in general you\u2019ll get at least 5-7 years before needing another service - maybe even longer.",

First off this watch/watches like this think date just/grand seikos non divers etc etc already walk a line of dressy sporty watches. Historically this watch woulda been worn on a leather strap of bracelet at best but more likely a strap. Since bracelet technology\u2019s come such a long way bracelets are in. This strap just brings everything down. Along with it be one of these Zulu pod thingys that never really sold me, ya it\u2019s just a 6/10. Comfort on 11 but looks on 4.. one of the only other times iv seen a rolex was a vintage dj on a dude that definitely knows watches I didn\u2019t say shit but judged the look of a fucking date just on a nato. This is one step more acceptable as the dj is more dressy objectively. I don\u2019t like the at that much at all I see it changing soon and hopefully in a big way\u2026 it deserves it, omegas history of non bezeled watches that walk the line of dressy and sporty is really really long. I now see all of those beautiful constellation and sea masters of old leading to this watch and this watch is not worthy of that in the slightest.",

        "body": "Boutique loyalty is definitely real, and if you have an established relationship and purchase history with a boutique then they would be seriously annoyed if you bought a watch from another one, thereby jeopardising whatever relationship you had built up to that point with them. \n\nThe boutiques are in competition with each other for sales figures and to be bringing in good repeat customers, bringing them to their events, etc. \n\nThat also means though that the second boutique in the scenario above would likely be quite happy to take your business and to take over your existing relationship - essentially to poach you from the first boutique. They likely won\u2019t see it as disrespectful but as an opportunity and a win for them. And I\u2019m saying this from experience. \n\nAll that said, it sounds like your existing relationship with your nearest boutique is fairly limited anyway at this point, given that your contact has left and you haven\u2019t bought the watch yet. So I don\u2019t think you have anything to lose, you only have potential upside. So my advice would be to actively tell the second boutique (on your business trip) that you had been discussing a purchase with the other one but that your contact has left and you haven\u2019t been happy with the indifferent service or engagement you\u2019ve had since, and you\u2019re looking to instead purchase from a different boutique and establish a relationship there. Give the impression that you would be interested in more watches over time. My guess is they will try hard to win your business and make you happy.",

I turned 40 last week, and as a way to celebrate and mark the occasion, I purchased this lovely 3590.50 from 1989. \n\nI\u2019ve been casually looking for a birth-year speedy for a while now, but a definite \u201c1984\u201d with papers or an extract has been hard to come by. My friend, Gregory, suggested that I widen the scope a bit and choose something from the \u201cperiod\u201d that had all of the characteristics that I like to look at. \n\nThis beauty\u2014originally sold on 3 June 1989\u2014popped on Lunar Oyster last Thursday night / Friday morning. After talking with the seller (Kirill) on the phone, I decided to move forward. \n\nIt came today. Wow. Look at that tritium. Look at that Tall \u201cS\u201d and Long \u201cR.\u201d Hands are original tritium, too, even though they have aged a little lighter than the indices (fires up beautifully for about two seconds under a black light ha ha). \n\nThe real 1450 is quite amazing. I have my 1861 on an Uncle Seiko, but the difference is noticeable. \n\nSide note: Kirill was exceptional to deal with.  He responded to my texts and phone call within minutes and answered all of my questions.  We scheduled an overnight shipment for yesterday so that I would be home to sign for it today (he gave me a few options, including shipping it immediately last week). Frankly, I\u2019ve been a fan of his website for some time (I particularly appreciate the way that he stages his watches and provides pictures from multiple angles), and I would definitely work with him again without hesitation.  \n\nTook it to my watch guys today and they time-graphed it for me. Running exceptionally well. \n\nHope you\u2019re all having a great \u201ctime\u201d today, too. \n\nBonus: me, age 5, in 1989. My grandfather was an optician, so I used to take sample glasses frames from his office to aid in my Clark Kent cosplay. (I am wearing this suit over my Superman pajamas. If only I had known then that when I tore open the dress shirt to reveal that magnificent \u201cS\u201d\u2014 it stood for \u201cSpeedmaster\u2026\u201d)",

They\u2019ve always used awesome watches from Panerai/Rolex to special Blancpain FFs and bonkers IWC/Porsche design Ocean 2000. \n\nThe British are still issuing divers made by CWC (which are basically a hybrid of the Rolex and Omega watches that it replaced) to units with a dive watch requirement. Cool watch and very old school tool like but it\u2019s more on par with the Rolex\u2019s and Omegas of the 1960s than it is with anything made today. \n\nThe SBS has moved on to Elliot Browns now. \nSupposedly they had a watch made for them to address shortcomings with the CWCs but I suspect the real reason is that their \u201cspecial\u201d black PVD CWCs became standard throughout the military and as such lost their \u201cspecial\u201d status. \n\nI own both (several of both in fact) and the CWC is a better **tool** watch IMO.",

My brother and I are both really into watches, and we often talk about the \u201ctiny\u201d gold colored Seiko on leather strap our dad wore when we were growing up(it looks 34mm if not probably smaller). As we\u2019ve gone through old pictures you can see it in all sorts of positions on his wrist, underneath, on top, sideways, higher on the arm, sometimes comical looking\u2026.but it was just so classic and cool since our dad was wearing it.  We are both really into smaller watches because of this.  Being a guy with quite a few watches, I am envious of the dude who wakes up, rubs the sleep out of his eyes while  grabbing his only watch and puts it on. It\u2019s his tool, not a lux accessory. I on the other hand spend so much time looking at and considering which watch I\u2019m wearing that day.  Kinda takes away from a watches\u2019 ability to develop character and history, when they\u2019re swapped out like women\u2019s hand bags.\n\nI hope you can get feeling better and get some more mobility back!!!",

And the distressing can be specified at different levels. \n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts. It\u2019s obviously a big watch, borderline too big. But I have big hands. I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d w 7.75\u201d wrists and pilots should be big so I went for it. The watch seems to fit my arm even though it\u2019s huge. My wife puts it on sometimes for a good laugh. \n\n\u201cThe hand made \"Erbst\u00fcck\" watch is a one of a kind. Traces of ageing give these timepieces a historic charm that usually can only be found at vintage models. \n\nLaco has developed a unique method to achieve this special look, creating a natural patina on the watches. Scrapes, scratches, discolouration and wear and tear can be reproduced to appear as they do on old originals.  All components - case, dial, hands or strap - are aged invidually and by hand, using a work-intensive procedure without mechanical aids, so the ageing looks absolutely authentic and none is alike.  This gives the watches the appeal of an historic timepiece, making each one completely unique - as individual and distinctive as its owner!\u201d",

He tended not to wear his Omega Deville during his work. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t wear my Seamaster or speedmaster to the gym. \n\nI save them for date nights once a week or special meals/ events. I have two this week for charity galas. \n\nOn top of that I used to take my speedmaster to work/gym which being a massive tech company had a gym on the main floor and  I would store it in my bag.\n\nAfter a shower one time I dropped it and smashed the hesalite. That was 800 dollars to fix at omega. I should add this was 1 month after its first ever 10 year service that cost over a grand! I waited 6 months maybe longer for it to be released. Both times skipping Florida service center and going straight to Switzerland. It\u2019s no fun living in the US when services are needed.\n\nI also got my 50s Seamaster serviced which was 890 dollars and 9 months, picked it up 2 weeks ago.\n\nJust so you know that\u2019s a little over 2700k in 3 years for 2 services and a hesalite replacement. Some folks won\u2019t even spend that on a watch never mind just servicing them. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s what you feel comfortable with. I still think there\u2019s a need for swatch and they do give immense enjoyment without the worry of a costly service.",

Probably the worst bezel action I\u2019ve ever felt, including Seiko, and absolutely the worst in this price point. It actually blows my mind that omega doesn\u2019t get this right when you consider how far they go on details which really don\u2019t matter much. If you want to know what I mean, try the bezel back to back with a submariner. Or SeaQ. If this doesn\u2019t bother you I\u2019d recommend never trying them back to back. \n\nThe titanium bracelet is extremely cool but not the most comfortable. As others have noted, the clasp / buckle is massive and protrudes. \n\nThe case size is still bigger than I\u2019d like. It\u2019s still thicker than it needs to be, and lug to lug is still longer than it needs to be. The cool factor is so high that I might have still bought this watch if it had more contemporary dimensions\u2026 which in 2024 is 39-41mm x 46-48mm\n\nIt\u2019s an aluminum bezel. Pros and cons to this, but many - myself included - would have preferred a matte finish ceramic over aluminum. \n\nSome don\u2019t like the faux patina. I don\u2019t mind it personally, but I get it. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. The price is too high but obviously you can find it for less than MSRP quite easily. It\u2019s still a stellar watch and as I\u2019ve said here and elsewhere before, I think it\u2019ll kick off an entirely new line of titanium divers for omega offered in all the colors you\u2019d want.",

Also the hands blend in with the dial at some angles which can make it hard to read the time at a glance - it's not as legible as all the press shots make it seem.  The bezel isn't very good, but that's probably the case with all SMP's - it's not easy to grip due to low profile and non-knurled edges in comparison to something like a Pelagos.

Putting the 300M on a $100 Milanese strap gets you about 90% of the way there, so that's what I ended up doing.\n\nStill a really cool watch. I just wish the contrast was better, markers were more cream and less brown, as well as bezel action being better and not worse, considering even the 300m bezel action is far from the best (bb58 is far better)",

Everything in perspective, right? \n\nThe rest of the time, I don't have an issue telling the time.\n\nI haven't noticed a bezel issue. I much prefer the bezel action on the Damasko watches (60 position, bidirectional, ceramic bearing instead of what I assume is metal tabs) but those cases on bracelets wear like a lead ball compared to the NTTD full Ti and have worse lume. If Tudor gave the standard Pelagos bidirectional bezel like the FXD so we could have a Ti bracelet, there might be something to get the NTTD off my wrist for a bit. But, until then, I'd say this watch has pros that, for me at least, tick more boxes than anything else I'm looking at 99% of the time.",

If you want a watch that can conform to your wrist, this isn\u2019t it(unless you have bigger wrists).  This and the longer lug to lug(50mm) are what kept me from getting this.  Omega really needs to go back to the 41mm watch dimensions.  Then it can really be head to head with the Sub.  I say this often(because I want the current Seamaster), but Rolex did such a better job sizing their \u201cflagship\u201d diver.  The Sub jives with just over 6\u201d wrists on up.  Sea master is closer to 7\u201d.  That long lug to lug phases so many out.  Or I should say it phases out those who appreciate a watch fitting \u201cwell\u201d!  Just my opinion.

Plus, the AD will budge on MSRP for the 300m; while you have to put a deposit down for Bond 60 and pay full MSRP.",

Hunt down some pics of the black on OEM\u00a0mesh (not Staib) before you pull the trigger. It really is so good in that config, and this comes from someone who absolutely lusted after the NTTD until I wore it for a little while in the store. It also doesn\u2019t have any associations with Bond, which frankly goes in and out of style.\u00a0\n\nOne last thing I remembered. I don\u2019t know if it matters to you, but the titanium case seams to amplify the sound of the self winding mechanism. Sort of makes the NTTD feel cheaper. Shake each around for a bit while up to your ear and you'll hear what I mean.\u00a0\n\nNot a single bad decision in the standard seamaster lineup right now. Do what makes you happy.",

It also to me seems more feminine than the Aqua Terra. If you like it though then my opinion is irrelevant.",

For his next 3 Bond movies her wore the same watch, but the automatic version.  I personally wear the automatic and it is a great watch.\n\nMy suggestion is to purchase the SMP because of the timeless look and the Bond tradition with Omega.  I think that watch will not lose value and is a better investment than the \u201clower desired\u201d Constellation.   It wears nice on the wrist and is not to thick.  While the bracelet is somewhat \u201cdated\u201d it still looks pretty good and you can always swap it out for a rubber strap or a leather band.  I just put mine on a blue string ray band the other day. \n\nLet us know how you make out!",

That watch is probably pre 2000 and the look compared to the latest Seamaster of today has not really changed tremendously.  People will know it\u2019s a Seamaster.\n\nThe Constellation can\u2019t seem to make its mind up\u2026..it\u2019s not really vintage and it certainly isn\u2019t modern.  It\u2019s confused.  It has Arabic an Roman numerals so really doesn\u2019t give off that Chrono racing vibe like a Speedmaster would.  It\u2019s on its way to becoming very dated in its look!\n\nGenerally I would say\u2026\u2026if you like the water, beach, boating, snorkeling etc to go with the SMP.  If you\u2019re more of a fast cars/fast women type go with a chrono.\n\nIn this case I would definitely go with the SMP\u2026..it\u2019s a no lose situation!",

I love that Omega has a much more varied catalog. But I don\u2019t think this is the right comparison, I\u2019d put the SMP300m up against the Explorer actually - or the Daytona up against the Speedy Pro. The Daytona feels nicer, and \u201chigher end\u201d, but in the end, it\u2019s unobtainium, and lacks the history of the Speedy (in fact, if you go off history, Rolex had to give them away with other watch purchased in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s, while the Speedy was busy beating it out to go to the moon lol). \n\nAnd I\u2019m not just saying this as an Omega fanboy (which I unashamedly am - but I also own Panerai, IWC, and Hamilton) - but the Rolex is the \u201cdefault\u201d watch. Be unique. Buy something you actually like, not something you think will impress other people - often people you don\u2019t even know.

Some people see it within the first year of ownership, other people after 2-3 years of ownership. But in any case, the problem is so severe that it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when. Some watchmakers suspect the issue stems from Rolex attempting to gain a 70 hour power reserve while using a single barrel, causing other issues in the movement design. \n\nSetting all of that aside, the Omega is also anti-magnetic to 15000 gauss while Rolex is notoriously silent about their parachrom hairspring antimagnetic specs. \n\nThat being said, none of that stopped me from buying a current 32XX calibre Rolex.

I love how neat midsize is but in another hand the pronounce presence and huge ceramic bezel on seaweed is very eye-caching (I mean to my eye, not other people's).\n\nThe dial is superb on both: applied omega sign and text along with inky black dial is stunning, so do the dark green waves on the seaweed.\n\nBracelet is winner on midsize, 18mm width makes it Okay to be not-tapered, also links are more rounded. \n\nIn matter of color scheme seaweed is a winner, love the absence of red, looks very clean and monochrome but in the same time it is still green watch haha",

The watches that are old (70s, 80s, 90s),  have a vintage design and are not desired that much, are faked alot less. Those vintage watches are not worth it to fake nowadays. So the fakes that exist are also old and easy to spot. \n\nOmega deffinetly does that. But if you want to check it fast. Go to an Omega watchmaker and ask him to check if it's real. He will open it and he certainly will recocnize if it's fake. But, in the mean time you can also do some research on the internet, so you can spot the obvious fakes.",

That being said, what are A) the statistical odds of a brand new Omega needing to be fixed under warranty in the first 5 years  due to a manufacturing defect ? And B) in case that happens, what are the odds it will cost more than the $2,100 I saved by buying from Jomashop. Those are two questions I asked myself before the purchase",

This small spot on your bezel could also have been made by you given enough time and if you had an accident like a ding or getting it hit. So personally I'd probably live with it... It'll happen all in good time with each wear. \n\nNow if it was a flaw that you know you would have not made accidentally, then you get this thing exchanged.\n\nI overcame my new watch OCD recently when I bought an aqua Terra 150m at an airport duty free in Korea. It was the one with the silver/white dial and orange second hand, always wanted it and it looked great... But it was the LAST one they had on the store, and a display model. I never do display models, don't want a watch someone touched that could have hair scratches or some idiot may have accidentally screwed the crown in wrong and stripped the screw, etc. But I sucked it up and bought it after a careful examination via a loupe for scratches. I come home and looked at the dial with the loupe more carefully and I found a single speck of black dust under the crystal on the dial... So small that you can't see it visually, but you can with a loupe. I learned to accept it as is... Nothing is perfect.",

It's the sapphire sandwich discounted down to around $6700 USD and duty free. I know you can get it from grey for around this price, but it's nice to get it from an OB at the same price.

I also want a guarantee that they are authentic - a service that eBay now provides (presuming you trust them). These watches join my \u201cwear it\u201d rotation. I don\u2019t worry about small bumps and scratches with these. I will occasionally buy a new watch that is not available in the US market. This was true with a Seiko Spring Drive GMT chronograph - it was not available in the US at the time. It was a dealer in Japan. I bought it and it was as described and came with the box and all the paperwork. When I got it, there was a small bit of debris on one of the subdials. It was not a paint or plating blemish, it was a fleck of paint or plating. My concern - if that got into the movement, it could cause a problem such as jamming the gears. I contacted Seiko USA and they told me to send them a photo - I did. They agreed that this was a manufacturing problem and said it would be repaired, but had to go back to Japan. I had to pay for shipping and it took six weeks, but it came back pristine. No more fleck on the subdial. They provided a test document - ran it for several days and its timekeeping was well within spec. I do wear that Spring Drive, but I don\u2019t if I am going to do something I know could be possibly hazardous to me and the watch (hiking, using some machine tools, etc). I like the increasing use of sapphire crystals - far fewer scratches on them now.",

Undoubtedly a Speedmaster soul with its lugs, minute and hour hands and Tachymetre scale. \n2. Not just an \"inferior\" and smaller Speedmaster, but has its own identity with the added complications and is fun to look at. \n3. Automatic with 54 hours power reserve, which i love because setting the date and month every time would be a nightmare. \n\nPaid it about 2k USD and it's in good condition, keeps time well (+7 sec per day) and the only real flaw was the scratched AR coating, which I polished off (I will replace the Crystal at the next service).",

Also fantastic after 20+ years. Probably saved $3000+ in service costs on the three quartzes over the years. This particular AT is also nice in that it has applied indices opposed to iterations with printed lume plots. At 38.5 it wears great. Again, it IS an Omega and will not draw anything but appreciative comments.

The dial on the new summer blue dial Seamaster is nearly illegible at certain angles if it's sunny outside.\n\nWhile the watches you mentioned are direct descendants, they have moved more to the luxury side with polished and reflective bits.  There is a huge market of people who would pay a lot of money for an Omega tool watch. \n\nI think the last non-limited edition that Omega had that could be thought of as a real tool watch was the original 2201.50 Planet Ocean.  When you look at pictures of that watch vs. the current Planet Oceans, they may look pretty close to the same (minus the aluminum vs. ceramic bezel).  But there is a BIG difference if you see them in person.\n\nI have not seen the new Planet Ocean colors in person.  The gunmetal one could be pretty good.",

I went through an AD who was nice enough to refund me the $900 Omega charges for a complete service. Omega\u2019s QC is not what you\u2019d expect from a high end watch manufacturer.

My date disc was non OEM so that is being replaced as well. I\u2019ve also enquired about replacing the dial as well as there is some wearing on one of the indices.

Chrono24 has brand new 2024 SMPs for around $4,500 on steel bracelet, and you can even get a brand new one from Joma Shop for under $5,000.\n\nEdit: at a secondhand shop, assuming he finds one actually willing to do a trade with him, he shouldn't take less than an even trade (and even that's a bad deal in my opinion).",

The case being entirely polished - even between the lugs - is a lovely touch, as well. The real winner here, though, is the bracelet. The teakwood ATs have a flat link bracelet that I absolutely despise. It's so hard to get a good fit because the links are large and there is no micro adjust. Whereas the shades AT has a bracelet reminiscent of a Rolex presidential. The links are small and it was easy for me to find a perfect fit.\n\nAlso, I would say the 41mm AT is awkwardly sized for an \"all dial\" watch. It's fairly thick and wears larger than the numbers might indicate. I've found the 38mm to be a wonderful sweet spot, where it doesn't look too small or too large.\n\nReally you should go try them on yourself and see which you prefer. At the price Omega wants for these watches, you gotta make sure before committing.",

I\u2019m looking and in Canadian dollars one is 14,700 and another is 17,400. I believe the only difference is the ceramic fold over clasp and of course I prefer that over the pin buckle. Is the foldover clasp worth 3,000 plus more.? Probably not but I\u2019m still seriously considering it. Am I missing anything? Are there more differences?\n\nAnyway, thanks for clarifying there\u2019s no matte black option. It must just be the lighting.

Mine was $12,000 USD MSRP when I purchased (plus tax of course), but I did manage a discount with my AD at the time.  When I purchased, there was no price difference between the pin buckle or the deployant clasp, but afterwards, if you have buyer\u2019s remorse, the upgrade to a deployant clasp if you purchase it stand-alone is about $600-$800 USD at the time I did the research - I was over in Europe so I think they quoted me around \u00a3650 if memory serves (including VAT).  \n\nThat said, $3K Canadian between the pin buckle vs. deployant clasp of the same model seems to be incorrect, that\u2019s crazy!  You\u2019ll always be better off getting the strap you want from the start, it\u2019s always more expensive purchasing separately as an accessory which is why this advice is usually given to always buy on the bracelet or get the higher grade strap/clasp, and then buy others afterwards.  However, $3K between the two seems way too high.  \n\nLooking at Omega\u2019s U.S. site right now it looks like the OG DSOTM with pin buckle is $12K USD and $12,800 USD with the deployant clasp so, $800 USD difference, which makes sense.  Seems you\u2019re not getting much of a \u2018discount\u2019 at all by going with the more expensive strap from new.  That said, even though the exchange rate causes the Canadian prices to be higher (although it\u2019s all relative to your local market), I can\u2019t imagine the difference in closures being at a very different scale.  I would definitely double-check that.  \n\nAs for the finishing, the site does do a decent job under \u201cDescription\u201d of detailing the case finishing of the different models.  I do remember the OG model has the most polished, ceramic surfaces while the \u201cpitch black\u201d and \u201cblack black\u201d have mixes of polished, brushed, and matte ceramic surfaces on various parts of the watch.  It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve handled the other models in-person, but I do remember both the \u201cpitch black\u201d and \u201cblack black\u201d \u2018feeling\u2019 more matte than mine.  \n\nEither way, they\u2019re all stunning and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love them.  I miss mine dearly and plan to get a new one within the next year.  \n\nCheers and enjoy it when you pull the trigger!  \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\n\n(Also, not ignorant questions at all if you\u2019ve never held them in person before - ceramic tends to be incredibly tricky to capture properly in either video or photos.)\n\nEdit: fixed some typos",

This watch was launched as the \u201cSpeedmaster Replica\u201d by Omega, honoring the 40th anniversary of the original Speedmaster CK2915-1. Omega quickly backpedaled on this advertising, realizing the negative connotation around the word \u201creplica\u201d. I really like the idea behind this release, as it feels like the watch we would\u2019ve gotten if the first Speedmaster was designed in 1997.

I\u2019m really looking forward to wearing this one, as the steel bezel reduces the already smaller apparent size of the Speedy, and the grey dial really looks good with a variety of straps.\r  \n\r\n\nBut mostly, I\u2019m glad to have a hand-wound speedy back.",

Omega Pros: The Omega is a better value for your money. World class diver, affordable, can take a beating. METAS certified (for what it\u2019s worth) and the co-axial escapement shortens the service interval significantly: Bond connection is a plus for me. Can be a good strap monster (Speedy is better for this). Ceramic bezel, great dial lume. The NtTD js fantastic. \n\n2. Omega Cons: the bracelet isn\u2019t great (the Milanese should be the standard going forward). The modern SMP is a little bulky and the dial can be busy. The bezel action is not that great but not horrible. \n\n3. (Modern) Sub pros: timeless, fantastic movement, great lume. Great resale value (not that important to me personally). Highly recognizable. Bezel action is fantastic (I love it), also has a great ceramic bezel. Oyster clasp bracelet is second to none. Fantastic dial lume. Starbucks is my favorite of the series(love that green).\n\n4. Sub Cons: relatively difficult to obtain at retail price (pretty readily available on the grey which is encouraging). I do not like the modern maxi-case, it\u2019s just too bulky for my taste (the older subs have such a great case).21mm lug width narrows your strap options although the sub usually doesn\u2019t migrate off of its bracelet anyway. \n\n5. Final thoughts: with respect to the modern sub and SMP, they both are great but for me they\u2019re not what I\u2019m looking for. I personally think the 300 Heritage beats them both (my only criticism of that is the 21mm lug width). I\u2019d love to see both series go back to the case dimensions of 90s and earlier models but keep: the modern movements, super luminova, oyster bracelet/milanese respectively.\n\nEdit: coaxial-escapement LENGTHENS the service interval. Good catch.",

Omegas are precise, durable and high end. Their coaxial movements however impressive are quite challenging to service. So upkeep costs on omegas are relatively high and most likely your local watchmaker might not be the best choice so might have to find a certified one and wait for months to get serviced. \nRolex is like an old German tank: nigh on indestructible, simple but holding some ingenious technical solutions. Made to be easily serviceable, my local town watchmaker can (and does) service them out of hand. They are very resilient, very precise, not quite as anti-magnetic as omega (if you believe some) but unless you repair transformers you don't have to worry. \n\nSo yeah, the quality and \"level\" is pretty much the same. Omegas make open case backs and have neat decorations. So if you care about that then it's probably important to point out.",

Then there\u2019s that extre nipple/crown (Helium escape valve), despite both being rated at 300 metres, Rolex manages it without the need for one. \n\nThen there\u2019s the Oyster bracelet which is amazingly stylish and comfortable and more secure at the clasp. \n\nThe steel used in the Submariner is more corrosion resistant to the point that you can now dive/swim in the ocean and not even rinse it in fresh water afterwards and it will be fine (even though I\u2019d still run it under a tap anyway), yet the Omega rusts within a week if not washed with fresh water. \n\nThe bezel movement is much crisper in the Sub, the Seamaster feels cheap. Despite both having glossy dials, the ceramic one is much more reflective (almost mirror like) so if you do use it diving, that doesn\u2019t help. \n\nThe new Submariner now uses ceramic tubes in the links between the bracelet, which makes them last longer and stay straight without bending over the years, and the movement is much smoother. The Omega with start bending sideways over time and the links are definitely not as high quality. Heck, even the new METAS Tudor (Rolex sister company) diver has ceramic ball bearings at the clasp. \n\nYou get what you pay for.

Bought the  heritage in my honeymoon because I loved the dimension, broad arrows were an awesome touch, and it had a lumed bezel. I love the bezel action on it as well. My only gripe is the 21mm lug length (for strap purposes) but its bracelet is leagues over the SMP. Looks great on a Milanese too. \n\nCompared to the SMP: dial isn\u2019t too busy, no date function (which I don\u2019t mind), better bracelet and great vintage look. \n\nCompared to the Sub: bezel action is comparable imo. Obtainable, bracelet is partially polished (which I think is cool), and looks less rectangular/bulky. \n\nGo try it on in person tho. I already have an SMP and it was great having something slightly different. I\u2019ve tried on the modern subs many times and it isn\u2019t quite what I\u2019m looking for (although I love that Starbucks bezel)",

But when the GMT Master II came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and economically. The GMT II has a clear crisp Jubilee bracelet, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the watch a luxurious sports feel. Rolex has been compared to Omega, but I think Rolex has a far more refined and historical watch catalogue. In \u201854 Rolex released this; ref. 6204 Submariner, their most classic timepiece. I think it\u2019s their best watch reference. A watch so classy, most people probably don't even use the watch for its intended purpose. But they should, because owning a luxury tool watch is not just about the pleasures of having a luxury item in your possession, it\u2019s about the ability to use watch and have it withstand the test of time.",

This post is so spot on that everyone wants to turn it into something it\u2019s not. I truly don\u2019t care about the HE Valve, I\u2019m not going diving, but I\u2019ve never had on a SMP and even noticed it. I personally like the wave dial, I\u2019m finding I gear towards dials of colors or textures more than just flat or glossy black far more just because they are more interesting to me. Where I will agree with the \u201cchange it\u201d crowd is the bracelet. I do wish it had some sort of taper to it or at least had an option to use a different one like on the new speedmasters or something. Maybe they could add some coining or something to the scalloped bezel for some better grip but again I\u2019m not diving so I really don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a tiny bit less grippy than other designs. I truly thing the two big things omega needs to do, and this is across the board not just with the seamasters, are 1) bring the thickness down (the absolute units if 17mm thick boys they\u2019ve been coming out with are crazy). And 2) bracelet upgrades, some taper and the quick adjust that already exists in many of their clasps should be extended to other models (looking at you Aqua Terra).",

While on their trip, he bought each of them a new Omega, as a coming of age present. Back then the average person could save up the money and do that. I think Omega needs to go back to that philosophy and lower their prices and make them more affordable for the average person. Just my 2c.",

It is now 42 with a 50mm L to L, and 13.6mm thick!! Let the planet oceans, Seadwellers, ploproffs, deep sea challenges, etc etc be \u201cbig\u201d.  The \u201cflagship\u201d divers should be designed to fit a broad range.  Rolex has done it with the Submariner at 40.5mm with a 48lug to lug and around 12.5mm thick.  No reason the Seamaster can\u2019t be an even 41 with a 48 lug and a bit trimmer. Those changes make a big difference. It would still look awesome on big wrists, and then work for smaller wrists.  Omega, keep the watch the same, just trim it up!  Just my opinion.",

White dial with orange second hand. I was hooked!! Left the OB with it. \n\nA few weeks ago, I randomly decided to walk into the OB again. I didn't know what to expect. He showed me the Seamaster PO Summer Blue. I'd never considered a PO before. But at 39.5mm, it was perfect for me on the wrist. \n\nI walked out with it.",

You can buy one directly off the Omega website (albeit for full retail).\n\nWhat discount level are we talking about from the AD? Most ADs can deliver a 10-25% discount depending on your relationship with the AD in question. The watch easily sells for below retail on the secondhand/grey market and isn\u2019t difficult to come by at all. \n\nUnless you have a longstanding relationship with this AD and/or have been promised a decent discount I would go buy the watch from any other retailer that wants to sell you it and not play games. \n\nIf the AD in question isn\u2019t offering you a discount I would repeat the advice above but laugh at them on the way out the door.\n\nEdit: I saw the discount of $5800 in your post history. It\u2019s not an awesome discount but it\u2019s the high end of fair market value. Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it unless you\u2019re really trying to build a relationship with this AD - for $500 more you can go to an omega boutique and get the full regalia experience plus a couple straps thrown in and tax waived - plus build a boutique relationship towards getting the actual hard to get pieces.",

He loves the lume in the bezel, which the standard Seamasters don't have. He doesn't like the faux patina of the lume. He doesn't like the helium escape valve. There is a mock-up at the end of the video, and I think what he proposes does looks great.

It shouldn\u2019t take much force, but it may be more than you\u2019re initially comfortable with. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s in the correct position if the seconds hand stops moving. \n\nOnce the seconds hand stops moving, you can turn the crown to adjust the hours and minutes hand. Once it\u2019s set, press the crown back in, and the seconds will start moving again. To adjust the date, pull the crown out to the second position. You should feel a small click, but the seconds hand should keep moving. Turn the crown, and the hour hand should \u201cjump\u201d in one hour increments. Keep turning the hour hand forwards or backwards until the date changes. When the date is correct, set the hour hand to the correct location, and push the crown in. \n\nNow, you\u2019ll need to push the crown in while also turning it, which is easier than it sounds. I also have an Aqua Terra, and it still takes a couple tries for me to get the crown started. Keep turning until the crown won\u2019t turn anymore, and you\u2019re done. \n\nRegarding service, every 5-8 years is the official recommendation from Omega. The watch you have is antimagnetic and fairly shock resistant, so there\u2019s actually very little you need to worry about to keep it running properly aside from the periodic service. Just make sure the crown is screwed down when you\u2019re done setting the watch, and be gentle with it while you\u2019re changing the time or have the crown unscrewed. \n\nI saw someone mention that you shouldn\u2019t change the date between 9 and 3, but doesn\u2019t apply to this watch. The act of changing the date requires you to move the hour hand through midnight, and it won\u2019t damage the watch. \n\nLastly, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.",

As a fellow owner of an Aqua Terra with an 8000-series movement, my biggest piece of advice is to use the jumping hour hand and date set as LITTLE as possible. The gear that allows for this function is so fragile that it needs replacement every 5-7 years and often fails before that (mine failed after o Lu a couple years and required repair by Omega). You will see the minute and hour hands come out of sync when it happens (i.e. the minute hand will need to be at quarter past the hour in order for the hour hand to line up with an hour marker).

I can\u2019t afford to be a collector, so if I own a watch worth thousands I need to want to wear it daily. \n\nThis is my second time owning this watch actually. I sold it to get something else, then went through a series of more trades trying to land on my favorite daily driver. I\u2019m glad I tried all of those other watches but I obviously circled back around to this for a reason. It\u2019s just great. I also forgot about the thickness measurement because it doesn\u2019t wear thick at all.",

To me, on a watch I spent way too much for, I may as well strive for the best. If I wanted a different strap for every day of the year, I would get the cheap ones. I will say, after owning one, I\u2019ll be buying my natos from Omega moving forward.",

I also bought a mesh bracelet before buying the OEM mesh which really didn\u2019t match up.. so from those experiences I\u2019m leaning towards just going straight Omega for the NATO but I\u2019d love some recommendations of any other brands with a less expensive similar style NATO to the one I\u2019ve listed above if you know of any",

I\u2019d only get the Omega rubbers if the design to match the equivalent metal band is critical to you - the Hydroflex are significantly more comfortable and durable. \n\nAs to aftermarket straps generally - happy to point you to some great options. Zuludiver tropic styles are excellent (and identical to StrapsCo tropics except for the superior buckle); Fluco nubuck, suede, and cordovan are outstanding; Veblenist makes excellent custom options; Forstner makes fantastic bracelets, including a duplicate of the OG 321 bracelet.

Less is more. Tyson wore a small watch on massive arms. You're probably considering it because you can get a good price, but the good price is because no one wants a watch like that. It's probably been sitting in their showcase for 3 years. \n\nJust to put some perspective, breitlings biggest watches are 46mm, Rolex 44mm, IWC 46mm, and even IWC who traditionally have made big watches have been transitioning to smaller, no one wants big watches, And you're going to have a hard time trying to sell it, if you chose to.

They both wear very different, and may be one would just feel more \"right\" on your wrist. The broad arrow does the speedmaster magic where it wears lower and slimmer than you'd expect. The day date wears a bit taller than you would expect. Definitely no loser between these two, good luck with your choice!",

Hopefully, you\u2019ll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Dad were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talking right now to my son Jim. But the way it turned out is I\u2019m talking to you, Butch. I got something for you.\nThis watch I got here was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the first World War. It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. Made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. Up till then people just carried pocket watches. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-grandfather\u2019s war watch and he wore it every day he was in that war. When he had done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother, took the watch off, put it an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed until your granddad Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War II. Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane\u2019s luck wasn\u2019t as good as his old man\u2019s. Dane was a Marine and he was killed, along with the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death, he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport name of Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he\u2019d never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your granddad was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his dad\u2019s gold watch.\nThis watch. This watch was on your daddy\u2019s wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp. He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it\u2019d be confiscated, taken away. The way your dad looked at it, that watch was your birthright. He\u2019d be damned if any slopes were gonna put their greasy yellow hands on his boy\u2019s birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.

My great grandfather was watchmaker almost 70 years and was lucky enough to see him at work for a few years. I have a few friends that are 3rd generation watchmakers (Omega, Rolex factory trained) and the difference in what their finished product is and Marshall\u2019s is still quite a bit of difference. (I have posted my pictures of my 67SP in this sub. I chose to keep it all original as I could, the only thing that is \u201cnew\u201d is the top pusher.)\n\nThe other problem that someone like Marshall will run into is he can\u2019t get new parts directly from Omega, Rolex, etc. they are  a closed loop for parts now and you have to be factory trained to get them. Also, many watch makers have new old stock. They just stock piled new (now vintage parts) and they don\u2019t give those up.  So getting anything for the OPs watch is insanely hard to get and not cheap. The pusher for my watch we sourced from my watchmaker\u2019s grandfather who is a watchmaker in Italy. That\u2019s the only way I got a pusher or spend over $1000 to source one on eBay if it\u2019s even available. \n\nSo in a nutshell parts, quality of work.",

In the worst case scenario, they can be stripped down to metal, repainted, and relumed. Both of these options don\u2019t cost too much, and hold more value than new service hands with luminova. \n\nSame goes with the dial. There are a few restoration experts in different parts of the world that can carefully clean the dial, redo the lume, and improve its appearance. Again, it won\u2019t ever be a mint dial, but it will still be worth at least double what a service dial is worth. \n\nThe bezel can be maintained or replaced, but that bezel in the pictured condition is still worth between $500-1000. Huge difference when compared to the value of a new bezel (about $200).\n\nThe movement absolutely should be serviced and rusty/damaged parts removed or repaired, but I\u2019ve see much worse watches saved and made to look presentable. \n\nUltimately, there is nothing wrong with having a watch with service parts, but OP would be better off selling this watch and using some of the money to get a watch with service parts if he so desired. Anything else is just throwing away a few grand.",

No harm no foul.\n\nBut this Speedmaster is an OG Ed White with a 321 movement. It\u2019s like trusting Bob Ross to do a museum restoration of a Rembrandt. This is no insult to Marshall (or Bob Ross), but there are professionals who dedicate their lives to this. Just because they\u2019re not in the limelight or on YouTube doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not every bit as passionate as Marshall. Not even local Omega boutique certified watchmakers themselves would touch one of these. This would need to be shipped to Biel, Switzerland to be restored at Omega HQ. Going outside of Omega, only a handful of specialized private watchmakers in the world has both:  \nA. The expertise to not butcher this restoration\nand\nB. A valid parts account with Omega to order parts. \n\nEven if we assume Marshall has A. He does not have B. And that will guarantee that this 321 movement doesn\u2019t get restored the way it deserves. Zimmerman Watch Co in PA or Archer (longtime watchmaker active on the Omega Forums) in Canada are two watchmakers which come to mind which could properly service this watch",

Omega site will have no disount and will have tax. Grey market like Jomashop will be even cheaper (https://www.jomashop.com/omega-watch-215-32-44-21-01-001.html) but don't have the original Omega warranty. That said, you might save enough money that you don't need to care. I do agree with others about trying it on first though.\n\nGood luck!
